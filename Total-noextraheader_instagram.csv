""I politely declined. We are in New York, where there is no law or tradition regarding headscarves,"" Amanpour, who was born in Britain to an Iranian father, wrote on Twitter.

The number of people who have died in the protests that have rocked Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini has risen to 31, AFP reported on Thursday, 22 September.

Additionally, the Iranian government also blocked access to WhatsApp and Instagram.

Instagram and WhatsApp are two of the most widely used apps in Iran after the blocking of other social media platforms in recent years like Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, and Tiktok.

Iran has been swept by nearly a week of protests since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested by morality police that enforce the clerics' rules on how women dress.

The Atlas VPN team has not disclosed the severity but has just published the number of vulnerabilities. The figures are from the VulDB vulnerability database. The report summarises vulnerabilities reported in the database between January 1, 2022, to October 5, 2022.

Mozilla’s Firefox browser comes second with 117 vulnerabilities, and Microsoft Edge comes third with 103 vulnerabilities, which is 61% higher than the previous year. Since its release, it has had 806 vulnerabilities in total, the report states.

Apple’s Safari is the second-most widely used browser worldwide after Google Chrome and is also the safest browser with just 26 vulnerabilities reported for 2022 and 1,139 vulnerabilities overall since its debut. The report advises users to be particularly careful while choosing plug-ins as they can be malicious and has asked users to choose only reliable providers.

Recently Indian cyber agency the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) issued a high-severity advisory regarding vulnerabilities in Chrome through which hackers can gain access and execute malicious operations in the system.

Google has one of the most transparent vulnerabilities reporting processes out of all the companies, and according to experts, the same will be fixed via updates. Current users can safeguard themselves by updating their browsers to the latest version.

The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out

In a video posted online by her France-based brother, Farideh Moradkhani urged “conscientious people of the world” to support Iranian protesters. The video was shared this week after her reported arrest on Nov. 23, according to the U.S.-based rights monitor HRANA.

The unrest, now going on three months, was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran for violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. Protesters have faced a brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces using live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas. At least 451 people have been killed, including 63 minors, according to HRANA. Another 18,173 have been detained, the rights monitor reports.

Moradkhani is a longtime activist whose late father (married to Khamenei’s sister) was an opposition figure. The branch of the family has opposed Khamenei for decades and Moradkhani has previously been imprisoned for her activism.

During a one-hour flight from Burbank to San Jose, California, SpaceX demonstrated the capabilities of Starlink to deliver WiFi for Netflix, YouTube, as well as video chats from 30,000 feet in the air, Bloomberg reported.

Bloomberg previously reported that SpaceX has pitched its internet service to four of the largest airline carriers in the US, including Delta, to no avail. The publication said that Musk's technology uses smaller and lower-flying satellites than competitors, which allows the WiFi signal to arrive faster. But, the smaller satellites might not be enough to power larger planes with more user demand, Bloomberg said. SpaceX has said Starlink can service planes of all sizes.

What's more, regulators have expressed doubt in SpaceX's satellite internet service. In August, the Federal Communications Commission rejected a $866 million subsidy for Starlink, saying the company ""failed to demonstrate that the providers could deliver the promised service"" and labeling it a ""still-developing technology.""

An Iranian protest anthem that has become the soundtrack to the national uprising was again thrust into the international spotlight over the weekend when @coldplay performed a cover and broadcast it live around the world.

The British band played the song, Baraye, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday and Saturday night at the start of their world tour, with the exiled Iranian actor @golfarahani on stage and singing in Farsi.

Baraye, which means “For …” or “Because of …”, was written by one of Iran’s most popular musicians, @shervinine, with verses taken from online posts by Iranians explaining why they have been demonstrating against the country's regime. Days after the song was released, the 25-year-old was arrested and his song deleted from Instagram.

Iran has been gripped by protests since the death in custody on 16 September of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old of Kurdish origin who was arrested in Tehran by the “morality police” over her headscarf. Amini was allegedly beaten, taken to hospital in a coma and later died.

Since then, protests led by women have been met with violence by authorities, with at least 270 people dead and 14,000 arrested, according to the group Human Rights Activists in Iran.

Friday’s concert was streamed via satellite to cinemas in 81 countries, although not in Iran, where playing or singing the song could lead to arrest.

A #Michigan woman is accused of targeting two teens in a year-long #catfishing scheme where she harassed them on social media.

Kendra Licari, 42, was charged earlier this week with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit the crime and another count of obstruction of justice. 

According to FBI investigators, Licari targeted her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend since last December and attempted to cover up her act by filing a complaint with the Beal City Schools‘ administration. 

Around that time, Licari worked as a girls‘ basketball coach at the school and at the end of the season, she was asked not to return due to coaching changes.

School district officials said the cyber bullying occurred off of school grounds and the school’s devices were not used. 

They decided to involve local authorities to look into the case as the harassment started in early 2021. 

Isabella County prosecutor David Barberi said the investigation was intense since Licari allegedly used slang to make it seem like the catfish was the same age as her daughter.

After authorities were stuck with no other options, they turned to FBI’s computer crime deviation in April and discovered a few months later that they believed Licari was involved in the cyberbullying. 

Superintendent William Chilman said in a statement that the FBI officials were able to track down the IP addresses used to send the messages to her daughter.

After Licari was confronted about the cyber harassment, she broke down and made a full confession. 

She was released often her arraignment and faces multiple charges which included using a computer to commit the crime, stalking a minor, and obstruction of justice. Each count is a five-year felony.

Since 16 September 2022, Iranian people have taken to the streets to protest against the Islamic Republic following the brutal murder of Mahsa Jina Amini, a young Kurdish woman, at the hands of government forces. 

The Islamic Republic has been a major source of oppression against women, religious and ethnic minorities, and Iranian society as a whole. Freedom is non-existent, the economy is deteriorating, the environment is degraded. Protests spanning across 146 cities have rapidly turned into Iran’s first ever feminist-led revolutionary movement. Its motto is “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” in Kurdish, “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” in Farsi, or “Woman, Life, Freedom” in English. 

Over 18,000 people have been arrested since the start of this revolution. Amongst them are people of all genders, ages, beliefs, and sexual orientations: children, striking workers, artists, lawyers, actresses, athletes, nurses and doctors, students and teachers, families of those arrested or killed. All those actively opposing the current regime know they are at risk of incarceration.

In addition, the Islamic Republic’s parliament has formally called upon the judiciary to impose death penalties against all jailed protesters. Though few have been sentenced to death so far, this move provides the grounds for others to suffer the same faith. Even one death sentence is one too many. This is one of the many strategies used by the government to deter opposition and protest. Other strategies include violence, torture, rape, as well as intimidation, harassment, and threats against activists and their families.",,,,"6,362",4.65,"“bricks of a revolution”

#SoheilaGolestani
Iranian actress-director Soheila Golestani was abducted from her home by #Iran’s security forces in #Tehran last week and taken to an unknown location after she published and appeared in a viral video staging a silent #protest with her colleagues without the #hijab. The video was a symbolic act of defiance in support of women’s rights and the revolutionary uprising which has swept Iran since the death of #MahsaAmini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was murdered while in custody of the morality police in Tehran.⁠
⁠
“Our true heroes are the nameless people. We do not cross out our mistakes. We practice and learn again. The ways are countless and the hope for a new day is strong,” Soheila wrote on her Instagram just before she was abducted. Her colleague, theatre Director Hamid Pourazari who appears in the video was also detained and taken to an unknown location by security forces. ⁠
⁠
There are growing concerns over the health of Soheila who suffers from a rare brain tumor and epilepsy and is at risk of seizures without medication and medical care. The Islamic Republic continues to deny vulnerable prisoners access to lifesaving healthcare and limits contact with their families. ⁠
⁠
The campaign of mass arrests in recent months which includes a growing number of women artists, journalists, activists and children is an attempt to silence voices and opposition. Those who are detained risk long prison sentence, torture and the death penalty. ⁠
⁠
TYTW is deeply concerned by reports of these arbitrary mass abductions and arrests of women and girls. TYTW stands with the brave women of Iran, and across the globe, fighting for #humanrights and bodily autonomy for women and girls everywhere. We must not allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to silence these women’s voices. Please share this post and bring global attention to the plight faced by the women and girls of Iran.

Alidoosti had condemned the hanging of Mohsen Shekari, who was killed in December in the first known execution linked to the protests, according to CNN.

Taraneh Alidoosti was arrested as there was a “lack of evidence for her claims,” CNN reported citing Fars news agency. In November, Alidoosti shared a picture of herself on Instagram without the Islamic hijab and holding a sign reading “Women, Life, Freedom” to offer support for the protest movement.

After Shekari’s execution, Taraneh Alidoosti in another post said, “Your silence means supporting tyranny and tyrants,” adding that “every international organization who is watching this bloodshed and not taking action, is a disgrace to humanity,” according to CNN. Since then, her account on Instagram has been deleted. She has featured in the 2016 Oscar-winning movie, “The Salesman” and has starred in various popular Iranian TV shows.

In its report on Alidoosti, Fars news agency said, “Some celebrities make claims without evidence and publish provocations and have been thus arrested,” according to CNN. The local rights group, Committee to Counter Violence Against Women in Iranian Cinema, in a post on Twitter said that it wasn’t clear which government department had taken Alidoosti into custody.

Earlier in November, Taraneh Alidoosti denied reports that claimed that she had left Iran. Alidoosti announced that she planned to live in Iran and affirmed her support for the families of prisoners.

According to CNN, Taraneh Alidoosti wrote, “I will stand by the families of prisoners and the killed and will demand justice for them. I will fight for my home and I will pay any cost to stand for my rights.”

As per the news report, several Iranians have been sentenced to death by execution during the nationwide protests which erupted after the death of 22-year-old woman Mahsa Amini. Amini was arrested by Iran’s ‘morality police’ for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. According to Norway-based Iran Human Rights, 458 people have been killed in the unrest since September.","ANTI-HIJAB PROTEST IRAN ARRESTS PROMINENT ACTRESS TARANEH ALIDOOSTI FOR SUPPORTING ANTI-HIJAB PROTESTS Earlier in November, Taraneh Alidoosti denied reports that claimed that she had left ran.

These protests are much more than the right to show our hair 

It’s the right to be seen as an equal🟰 
Not as a fraction of a human like we are considered under Iranian law today (and I am a citizen)

In Iran, a woman’s voice is considered half of a man for in court for every one male witness you need two women. Because only 2 womens voices can be equal to 1 mans.. can you imagine?

And this is just one of the many rights we are fighting for

The right to have custody of our children (even an abusive husband gets full custody)
The right to travel without a man’s permission
The right to be in positions of power
The right to equal land
The right to sing
The right to dance

The right to exist as a female

Without being seen as a threat or distraction that must be covered by weak men

Right now young women are the biggest threat to this regime
They are targeting us because they fear our wisdom, our courage, our ferocity for truth

And that we don’t need another hashtag of another name of one of our lost ones💔

The data dump was identified by Chad Loder, the founder of cyber security awareness company Habitu8, who shared the news in a post to his Twitter account on November 23 - and his account was suspended shortly after posting.

Loder announced the attack impacted users in the European Union and the United States and the data exposed is enough to unleash phishing attacks to obtain login credentials. 

Removing Loder's tweets and suspension has sparked concerns that Twitter is trying to hide the issue, with some Twitter users saying Musk 'banned [Loder] for exposing how weak Twitter security is.'

The user data was first posted on a hacking forum with a $30,000 price tag in July, but the recent sale offers this information for free, according to Bleeping Computer.

removing loder's tweets and suspension has sparked concerns that twitter is trying to hide the issue, with some twitter users saying musk 'banned [loder] for exposing how weak twitter security is.'

the user data was first posted on a hacking forum with a $30,000 price tag in july, but the recent sale offers this information for free, according to bleeping computer.

Dear [Media Exec],

I am writing to express my concern over the lack of coverage of the ongoing protests in Iran and the reported executions of protestors. As leaders in the media industry, it is your responsibility to inform the public about important events happening around the world, and the situation in Iran deserves urgent attention.

As you are likely aware, the people of Iran have been protesting in large numbers against the government and its policies, with some reports suggesting that the protests may be the largest the country has seen in decades. These protests are a crucial moment in Iran's history and deserve the attention of the international community, including the news media.

Furthermore, there have been disturbing reports of the Iranian government cracking down on the protests with violence, including the use of live ammunition and the execution of protestors. It is essential that these reports be investigated and covered in the media in order to hold the Iranian government accountable for its actions and to provide a voice for the protestors.

I urge your news organizations to prioritize covering the Iran protests and the reported executions of protestors. The people of Iran deserve to have their stories heard and their struggles highlighted in the face of such grave injustices.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]

While university students have played a pivotal role in the protests with dozens of universities on strike, unconfirmed reports on social media showed workers at Abadan and Kangan oil refineries and the Bushehr petrochemical plant have joined in.

A video on Twitter showed dozens of workers blocking the road to the Bushehr site in Assaluyeh on Iran's Gulf coast, and chanting ""death to the dictator"".

Iran's Oil Ministry was not immediately available to comment.

Protests have swept the country since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iran's Kurdish region, died on September 16 while being held for ""inappropriate attire"", marking one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.

That revolution, in which the clergy swept to power, was helped by a combination of mass demonstrations and strikes by oil workers and Bazaar merchants.

However, analysts say the Iranian regime will likely contain unrest for now, and prospects of an imminent dawn of a new political order are slim.

Bolt was recently told there was only about $12,000 remaining in the account, his lawyer Linton P. Gordon said in a phone interview, according to Bloomberg.

The account was said to be part of Bolt’s retirement and lifetime savings.

“It’s distressful news for anyone. And certainly in the case of Mr. Bolt, who established this account as part of his private pension,” Gordon said on Wednesday.

Jamaica’s Financial Services Commission on Tuesday said it had installed its own temporary manager at SSL, following reports of allegations of fraud that had earlier prompted the commission to put the bank under enhanced oversight.

Gordon said regulators have not communicated with him or his client, adding that if Bolt does not see the money returned within eight days, he plans to take the case to the Supreme Court in Kingston.

Bolt, an eight-time Olympic gold medal winner, is considered the world’s fastest man, holding world records in the 100-meter and 200-meter races.

Protests are now being reported in every province in ⁦‪the country‬⁩. The government admits to killing 35 but Amnesty says they shot 19 people dead — including 3 children — on Wednesday night alone.

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as: 

#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics etc. get creative! 

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented. 

4. Organize to support iranians where you live 
Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country. DISCLAIMER: Due to sanctions against Iran, it is illegal to fundraise to send money there legally. Be wary of funds collection",,,,"2,941",3.95,"repost @the.wellness.therapist

Binance said late Thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB tokens off the network. So-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.

The company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on BSC, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.

Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

“An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC,” Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, said in a tweet Thursday evening.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”

BNB Chain has since resumed operations.

In total, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, Binance’s BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.

The hack was caused by a bug in the bridge’s smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm Immunefi. Smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.

#bitcoininvestors",2 Time m 1H BINANCE 1W 1D 1M കുലലN 6759.00 $570 MILLION HACK CRYPTO EXCHANGE BINANCE WAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS BLOCKCHAIN AFTER IT WAS HACKED FOR $570M WORTH OF BNB BNB CHAIN HAS SINCE RESUMED OPERATIONS. ALTCOIN DAILY,,,"2,859",1.57,"cryptocurrency exchange binance temporarily suspended its blockchain network after hackers made off with around $570 million worth of its bnb token.

binance said late thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its bnb chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move bnb tokens off the network. so-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.

the company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on bsc, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.

binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

“an exploit on a cross-chain bridge, bsc token hub, resulted in extra bnb. we have asked all validators to temporarily suspend bsc,” changpeng zhao, binance’s ceo, said in a tweet thursday evening.

“the issue is contained now. your funds are safe. we apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”

bnb chain has since resumed operations.

in total, hackers drained 2 million bnb tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, binance’s bnb chain said in a blog post on friday.

the hack was caused by a bug in the bridge’s smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm immunefi. smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.

Actress Jessica Chastain insists it is “really important” for her to raise awareness about the ongoing protests in Iran and she has hailed the “women-led revolution” taking place in the country.

The ‘Good Nurse’ actress used her Twitter account in September to shine a spotlight on the tragic death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was murdered by the country’s morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly, and she is closely following the ongoing reaction to the shocking incident, which has sparked waves of women cutting their hair or shedding their head coverings in protest, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

She told ‘Entertainment Tonight’: “It’s really important for me to use my platform to amplify anyone’s struggle for freedom and peace and safety. And what’s happening in Iran right now is heartbreaking to me. I’m following the news every day as I hope everyone is, and my heart’s with those girls.”

Chastain praised the “strength” of the women in speaking out and hailed their actions as “incredible”.

She added: “This is a women-led revolution. And I have such belief in them, and I send them so much strength and love and support. And I think it’s incredible what they’re doing.”

Chastain’s new movie, ‘The Good Nurse’, sees her play Amy Loughren, a nurse who was forced to turn detective when she discovered one of her colleagues was responsible for the murder of dozens of patients across nine hospitals over 16 years.

And the 45-year-old star was keen to make the real-life story because she is keen to “amplify the stories of women”.

She said: “It’s part of the reason I wanted to make the film. I love using my platform to amplify the stories of women, because I find that (in) this country, for some reason, they haven’t been acknowledged up until now. And so, I want to celebrate women’s heroism and their incredible stories, and Amy’s story is mind-blowing and compassionate.”

“She’s a hero.”

Nika Shakarami was one of thousands of Iranian women who took to the streets to protest the horrific killing of Mahsa Jina Amini.

She joined the protests in Tehran
on September 20. And then she disappeared.

She had gone with friends, who said she had been fearlessly chanting in Mahsa's name.
But as night fell, the protests grew more intense, and Nika was separated from her friends.

In her last known communication, she told them that she was being chased by security forces.

Then her phone was turned off and her Telegram and Instagram accounts were deleted.

Frantic, her family searched everywhere for her.

She was missing for 10 days.

Then they found her dead body at a morgue in a local detention center.

Her nose had been completely smashed in, her skull broken from multiple blows.

The family were told that Nika had been held by the IRGC and briefly detained in Tehran's
notorious Evin Prison - the IRGC tried to claim that she died after ""falling from a great height.""

Her family was then pressured by the authorities to not hold a funeral ceremony and bury her in
silence.

Despite being forced into agreeing, the authorities then stole her body and buried her 40km away in order to avoid publicity and suppress further protest.

She was buried on what would've been her 17th birthday.

On top of all that, there are reports stating that Nika was repeatedly raped and suffered sexual torture, and that a large cut down the middle of her torso indicated that her organs had been removed.

WE DEMAND JUSTICE!
Share this and amplify the voices of Iranian women. The world needs to know the oppression and the violence that the women over there are risking, just by existing and fighting for their rights!!!

the family were told that nika had been held by the irgc and briefly detained in tehran's
notorious evin prison - the irgc tried to claim that she died after ""falling from a great height.""

her family was then pressured by the authorities to not hold a funeral ceremony and bury her in
silence.

despite being forced into agreeing, the authorities then stole her body and buried her 40km away in order to avoid publicity and suppress further protest.

she was buried on what would've been her 17th birthday.

on top of all that, there are reports stating that nika was repeatedly raped and suffered sexual torture, and that a large cut down the middle of her torso indicated that her organs had been removed.

we demand justice!
share this and amplify the voices of iranian women. the world needs to know the oppression and the violence that the women over there are risking, just by existing and fighting for their rights!!!

stand up, rise and protest!!!",True,accounts were delete

These are some of the people living in North America who have a long track record of lobbying in support of Khamenei’s regime occupying Iran. They’re mainly active on Twitter, in addition to making media appearances and publishing articles to echo the talking points of the regime in English to a Western audience. They do this by presenting themselves as “progressives” who just want peace and stability. Their main tactic is to use nice sounding terms such as “anti-war” and “diplomacy” to make it seem like they are not on the side of the regime. But their main goal is to keep this ISIS-style dictatorship in power no matter what. They have been lying to their Western audience for years, claiming that people in Iran do not want the regime gone, they just want “reforms”. This, of course, is absolute nonsense. They falsely accuse political prisoners, family members of innocent people killed by the regime, and other Iranian activists, of being “warmongers”. They whitewash the crimes of the regime and have always tried to hijack mass protests in Iran to misrepresent them.

With the recent huge anti-regime protests taking place in Iran and the clear message of the Iranian people, which is that they do not want the Islamic Republic in power, their constant rambling has not stopped one bit. Their tactics slightly change from time to time to fit the situation and not be too evident, but their goal is always the same. Some of them are desperately trying to save face now, even going back to delete their previous articles, tweets, and videos. Of course, it’s too late and completely pointless since people have downloaded, taken screenshots, and saved it all!

Stay alert, know their names, and do not fall for their tricks! Iran will be free one day, and when that day comes, I assure you that Iranian people will not forget or forgive those who for years lobbied for that barbaric oppressive regime while living comfortably in North America!

⁠
Rekabi was met by hordes of reporters and admirers at the Imam Khomeini international airport, many of whom applauded, chanted her name and called her a hero.⁠
⁠
All female athletes from the Islamic Republic are required to wear a hijab during competitive sports and international appearances. On Sunday, Rekabi competed in Seoul wearing just a black headband with her dark hair tied in a ponytail. Iran’s flag was emblazoned across her shirt.⁠
⁠
Supporters of Rekabi believe she actively chose not to wear the headscarf in response to intense protests in Iran following the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained by Iran’s morality police. Amini was accused of breaking a morality law that requires women to wear a headscarf, cover their arms and legs and wear loose clothing.⁠
⁠
The demonstrations, drawing school-age children, oil workers and others to the streets in over 100 cities across the nation, represent the most serious challenge to Iran’s theocracy since the mass protests surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Many Iranian women have since removed their government mandated hijabs in public.⁠
⁠
At the airport, Rekabi maintained to reporters that not wearing a hijab in Seoul was “unintentional.” A statement allegedly from Rekabi was posted to social media this week where she claimed she “forgot” to wear her hijab after leaving a women’s-only waiting area prior to her competition.⁠
⁠
Rekabi appeared at the Imam Khomeini International Airport wearing a ballcap and hoodie to cover her hair.⁠
⁠
The Iranian government routinely pressures activists at home and abroad, often airing what rights group describe as coerced confessions on state television — the same cameras she addressed on her arrival back home.⁠

Lapsus$ hacking group has been creating a ruckus with the group targeting Tech giants like Microsoft, Samsung, and NVIDIA. In March this year, London City Police had arrested 7 teenagers in connection with these hacking incidents. One of the seven was a 16-year-old boy from Oxford, who was arrested because other hackers leaked his name and address online. The lad uses ""White"" and ""Breachbase"" as his online aliases.

It is reported that the teenager made around $14 million from his cybercrimes. After a lull of a few months, GTA6 leaks went viral, and over 90 videos of RockStar Games' most awaited video game got leaked on GTAForums, around the same time global ride-hailing giant Uber suffered a data breach as well.

Hackers have posted on Doxbin, that its 'Arion', the same teenager from Oxford, who goes by the online alias of 'White' or 'Breachbase', was behind the GTA6 and Uber data breaches.

Interestingly, The 'teapotuberhacker' gave 'Uber Hack' as a 'Past work' reference on the GTAForums while leaking the GTA6 videos. This could mean only one thing, that is Mr. 'teapotuberhacker', 'Breachbase', and 'White' is the same person, the teenage hacker from Oxford.

My tribute to honor the Persian leopard's mythical wish to be above the moon.

Yet stories are not to ignore the reality around us, are they? As they are coming out of true experiences, they can make changes for real, they can prevent some tragedies from happening again and again.

Jina, officially named Mahsa Amini was a 22 years-old Kurdish woman visiting Tehran where she was arrested by Morality police for not complying with a compulsory hijab and later died in hospital due to potential police brutality. Her death lit such a fire in hearts that brought numerous people into the streets all over the country (Iran) to protest. Not only to demand justice for her death but for their stolen freedom and the respect every human being deserves.Their bravery is beyond my words!
_ 

Since yesterday, Iran has shut down the internet and blocked social media platforms to silence their voices. At this point, a possible massacre may happen as it happened in 2019. In such a critical condition, Anonymous hackers are supporting people against oppression while Meta is supporting oppression by removing related posts from Instagram (non-violent content), and by blocking Iranians What’s app accounts! Your voice matters cause you can be their voice!
_ 

Her official name Mahsa means ""moon alike"". Her given name Jina is a Kurdish name which I think has the same origin as the word gene, meaning reproductive, alive, and life-giver. Let's be her name, and let's multiply her by disseminate her story as a symbol who freed a land from demons of darkness. As her mother said, also her epitaph: ""Jina, my dear, you won't die! Your name will become a symbol."" 

This painting has been shared as an expression of sorrow, but not anymore. Please share this post and ask people to read the caption and share it using the hashtag #MahsaAmini if they like! It was her birthday yesterday and this is my gift to her!

His friends have not heard from him since. They fear he has been arrested.

Khezrnejad's disappearance comes at a time of great civil unrest in Iran. Protests and calls for the removal of the current Iranian government have been ongoing throughout the country since a young woman named Mahsa Amini died in police custody in September.

Those demonstrations have been met with increasingly brutal responses from the government-controlled Iranian security forces.

""I had never seen Ayub speaking this way. The feeling in his voice … stressed, frustrated, shocked,” his friend said about Khezrnejad’s 45-second video. 
•
CBC News is not naming the friend due to the potential danger to his family in Iran.
•
Khezrnejad completed his master's program in the fall of 2015 at Memorial University in St. John's. He returned home to Iran in early 2017.
•
When they last spoke in 2019, Khezrnejad was doing well, his friend said. 
•
His friend said nobody has heard an update from Khezrnejad since he showed up to the judiciary summons. It’s unclear when that was. Some of the earliest posts reporting that Ayub had been detained were on Nov. 24.
•
His friend hopes this will be one more example of why people outside of Iran need to speak up for those still living in his home country.

The poll earned a response from Ukrainian diplomat Andriy Melnyk, who told the billionaire to “f— off” shortly after the tweet was posted.

Kendra Licari,42, was charged earlier this week with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit the crime and another count of obstruction of justice. According to FBI investigators, Licari targeted her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend since last December and attempted to cover up her act by filing a complaint with the Beal City Schools‘ administration. Around that time, Licari worked as a girls‘ basketball coach at the school and at the end of the season, she was asked not to return due to coaching changes.

School district officials said the cyber bullying occurred off of school grounds and the school’s devices were not used. They decided to involve local authorities to look into the case as the harassment started in early 2021. Isabella County prosecutor David Barberi said the investigation was intense since Licari allegedly used slang to make it seem like the catfish was the same age as her daughter.

After authorities were stuck with no other options, they turned to FBI’s computer crime deviation in April and discovered a few months later that they believed Licari was involved in the cyberbullying. Superintendent William Chilman said in a statement that the FBI officials were able to track down the IP addresses used to send the messages to her daughter.

After Licari was confronted about the cyber harassment, she broke down and made a full confession.

kendra licari,42, was charged earlier this week with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit the crime and another count of obstruction of justice. according to fbi investigators, licari targeted her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend since last december and attempted to cover up her act by filing a complaint with the beal city schools‘ administration. around that time, licari worked as a girls‘ basketball coach at the school and at the end of the season, she was asked not to return due to coaching changes.

school district officials said the cyber bullying occurred off of school grounds and the school’s devices were not used. they decided to involve local authorities to look into the case as the harassment started in early 2021. isabella county prosecutor david barberi said the investigation was intense since licari allegedly used slang to make it seem like the catfish was the same age as her daughter.

after authorities were stuck with no other options, they turned to fbi’s computer crime deviation in april and discovered a few months later that they believed licari was involved in the cyberbullying. superintendent william chilman said in a statement that the fbi officials were able to track down the ip addresses used to send the messages to her daughter.

after licari was confronted about the cyber harassment, she broke down and made a full confession. she was released often her arraignment and she faces multiple charges which included using a computer to commit the crime, stalking a minor, and obstruction of justice. each count is a five-year felony.

however, it is unclear why licari committed the crime and she is expected to appear in court on december 29⛓️👀🤦🏽‍♂️📲 thoughts",True,harassment

This religious symbol represents Iran’s theocratic oppression, gender apartheid and hate which most Iranians reject and want removed. Allah was added to the flag after the Islamic revolution in 1979 by the regime. Thank you team USA. Many Iranians are also posting thank you comments under their page.

“While she was scaling that wall in Seoul without the state’s forced hijab, Ms. Rekabi was showing the world who she is: A professional climber and Iranian woman with a spine of steel,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“She, like countless women in Iran, has risked everything to tell the world that she opposes the state’s policy of forced hijab, and we are extremely worried about her safety,” he added.

“Ms. Rekabi risked her freedom and safety and has since been under extreme pressure by the government to cover up her courageous act of civil disobedience,” said Ghaemi. “It is now the responsibility of all people who support women’s and human rights to stand with her and not let the government in Iran cover up the true story.”

CHRI stands by Iranian athletes who are calling for the government in Iran to be held accountable for its repressive policies, and calls on the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFCS) to suspend Iran’s membership.

CHRI also urges the IFCS, climbing professionals and the international community to not accept the Iranian government’s attempts to flip this story.

These groups and individuals should make statements in support of Rekabi, who has not been allowed to speak freely since she competed, and all women in Iran who are risking their lives to speak out against repressive state policies.

Those journalists include Niloofar Hamed, who was the first person to report Mahsa Amini's story. 

She has now been in solitary confinement for almost a month, according to her lawyer.

Ms Hamedi shared a photo of Ms Amini's parents hugging each other in a Tehran hospital, where their daughter was lying in a coma. 

The photo, posted on Twitter on September 16, was the first sign to the world that all was not well with 22-year-old Ms Amini, who had been detained three days earlier by Iran's morality police for what they deemed inappropriate dress.

Ms Amini's death later that day would unleash a wave of mass protests across Iran that were still persisting nearly three weeks later in different parts of the country, despite a government crackdown.

The photo of Ms Amini's parents was also one of the last things Ms Hamedi, who worked for the pro-reform Sharq Daily, would post before she was arrested some days later and her Twitter account listed as suspended.

""This morning, intelligence agents raided my client Niloofar Hamedi's house, arrested her, searched her house, and confiscated her belongings,"" Ms Hamedi's lawyer Mohammad Ali Kamfirouzi tweeted on September 22.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called on Iranian authorities to ""immediately and unconditionally release … all journalists arrested because of their coverage of Mahsa Amini's death and the protests that have followed"".

It said last month that at least 28 journalists had been detained by the security forces, including Ms Hamedi.

Friends of Ms Hamedi described her as a brave journalist, passionate about women's issues and rights.

""She always went beyond her limit to be the voice of voiceless women who were deprived from their rights, whether by their fathers, husbands or by social limitations,"" one friend told Reuters.

""Canada strongly condemns the reprehensible detention and killing of Mahsa Amini,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly. 
 
""Her death was a direct result of the systemic and continued harassment and repression of women by Iran. We further condemn the violent crackdowns on civilians, which have caused additional deaths and injuries, in blatant violation of their human rights. We salute the courage of the Iranian women who are peacefully protesting and we join them in sending the regime a very clear message: they must end all forms of persecution and violence against women.""
 
University Canada West fully supports the Government of Canada’s position.
 
In recent days I have been in contact with many people from UCW’s Iranian community. UCW is home to hundreds of international students from Iran, as well as Iranian faculty and staff. This is a time of deep anxiety for them amid concern for the safety of family and friends. On behalf of UCW, I express our community’s solidarity with them.
 
I remind all our students, faculty and staff that here in Canada, whether as citizens, landed immigrants or international students with a visa, your rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech and freedom from discrimination are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. No advance permit is required to organize or gather in support of a cause.
 
I encourage students, faculty and staff who are affected by or concerned about these events to reach out to support services available both on campus and on-line. UCW is a truly international community with students from around the world here on our campuses. Let's pull together to support those who are struggling.

More than $600 million in crypto left bankrupt crypto company FTX’s wallets late Friday, with little clear explanation as to why.
Soon afterwards, FTX stated in its official Telegram channel that it had been hacked, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps.
“FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don't go on FTX site as it might download Trojans,” wrote an account administrator in the FTX Support Telegram chat. The message was pinned by FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller.
According to on-chain data, various Ethereum tokens, as well as Solana and Binance Smart Chain tokens have exited FTX’s official wallets and moved to decentralised exchanges like 1inch. Both FTX and FTX US appear to be affected.

On Jan. 8, 2020, Esmaeilion’s wife, Parisa, and only child, 9-year-old Reera, were killed when the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 shortly after it took off from Tehran’s international airport. The mother and daughter were returning to Canada after visiting family in Iran over the winter holidays. Esmaeilion, a dentist and writer whose novels critical of the Islamic republic were growing increasingly popular inside and outside Iran, had stayed behind in Toronto, knowing that if he traveled with his family, he would probably run into trouble with Iranian authorities.

After the horrific crash, Esmaeilion returned to Iran to take possession of his family’s remains for burial in Canada, overcoming threats and obstacles from Iranian authorities. In the months after his return to Toronto, Esmaeilion and relatives of others who died in the plane crash formed the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, for which he continues to serve as spokesman.
Their simple goals were justice for the dead and accountability for the perpetrators. But their efforts ran into bureaucratic roadblocks, a pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and apathy from a world desensitized by an endless diet of bad news.

That is, until this past September, when protests erupted in Tehran after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Among the many members of the Iranian diaspora who amplified the demands of protesters inside Iran were members of the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims.

Now Esmaeilion has become a leading voice outside Iran in the anti-regime movement — an essential bridge between Iranians in diaspora who want to promote a freer future for their homeland and the millions inside Iran who live under an abusive system that has long operated with impunity.

Trudeau tweeted on Monday evening that Canada “denounces the Iranian regime’s barbaric decision to impose the death penalty on nearly 15,000 protestors. These brave Iranians were fighting for their human rights — and we continue to stand united in support of them, and united against the regime’s heinous actions.”

Within that tweet, however, there is a false premise that Iran is planning to execute “nearly 15,000 protesters” arrested in the wake of street protests and violent rallies sparked in mid-September by yet another piece of fake news – the alleged police killing of 22-year-old woman Mahsa Amini.

Trudeau’s post, despite being immediately dismissed as false by several Twitter users, remained up for more than 11 hours and was shared thousands of times before it was deleted.

While the Canadian prime minister may have been the most important politician who shared the fake story, there were countless others who piled on – whether intentionally or unintentionally – and condemned the Islamic Republic thanks to the incredible lie.

The fake report especially went viral on Twitter and Instagram, where an infographic claimed that “Iran Sentences 15,000 protesters to death — as a ‘hard lesson’ for all rebels.” Many celebrities also fell for the lie and shared it with their followers.

The emissions monitoring company @ghgsat attributed the plume to the oil and gas sector and estimated methane was spewing at a rate of 795 kilograms an hour at the time of the observation. 

The emissions occurred near the Arsanjan-Kheirgoo Gas Compressor Station. The site’s three compressors help ship as much as 110 million cubic meters of gas a day from the South Pars field 1,050 kilometers (650 miles) north to Tehran and were designed to increase transmission capacity during the winter heating season, according to a promotional video from the site's operating subsidiary Sekafco.

National Iranian Oil spews more methane than any other global energy producer according to a report last week by the San Francisco-based Global Energy Monitor. The non-profit group found that just 30 fossil fuel companies account for nearly half of the sector’s emissions of the potent greenhouse gas. (See the list in the article at the link in our bio.)

Methane is the primary component of natural gas and responsible for about 30% of the Earth’s warming. Releases and leaks can occur during extraction and transport of the fossil fuel.

Scientists say reducing the emissions of methane, which has 84 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere, is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to cool the planet.

All throughout the #COP27 climate talks, Bloomberg Green will exclusively publish new satellite images of methane releases captured around the world, in collaboration with GHGSat.

The report by Atlas VPN has stated that these figures are based on data from the VulDB vulnerability database, covering January 1, 2022 to October 5, 2022.

As per the report, Google Chrome is the only browser with new vulnerabilities in the five days in October. Recent ones are CVE-202203318, CVE-2022-3314, CVE-2022-3311, CVE-2022-3309 and CVE-2022-3307.

The CVE programme tracks security flaws and vulnerabilities across multiple platforms. The database does not list details for these flaws, but the report said they can lead to memory corruption on a computer.

Users can fix these by updating to Google Chrome version 106.0.5249.61. Reportedly, Mozilla’s Firefox browser is in second place for vulnerabilities with 117 of them.

Microsoft Edge was reported to have 103 vulnerabilities as of October 5, with 61% more than the entire year of 2021. Overall, it had 806 vulnerabilities since its release.

Talking about Safari, it has some of the lowest levels of vulnerabilities in comparison with others. In the first three quarters of 2022, it witnessed 26 vulnerabilities and its number of cumulative vulnerabilities were 1,139 since its release, the report said.

Notably, the Opera browser had no documented vulnerabilities so far in 2022 and only 344 total vulnerabilities.

As of May 2022, Safari has witnessed over a billion users and Apple has been working hard to make sure its browser is secure and safe to use.

The Russian Vedomosti news agency has revealed in an article that Russia and Iran are gearing up to launch a new gold-backed stablecoin.

This new stablecoin would be used for cross-border transactions instead of USD and other fiat currencies, and it would first  operate in a special economic zone in Astrakhan, where Russia is accepting cargo shipments from Iran. Iran is exploring new alternative methods of conducting foreign trade in the context of ongoing international trade sanctions against the country. 

According to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain, the token is anticipated to be released in the form of a stablecoin backed by gold (RACIB). Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath was excited at this news and tweeted, ""Iran and Russia to issue a new stablecoin backed by Gold. Damn, if this picks up could be day 1, event 1 of establishing a new economic order everywhere. No idea why it's getting no oxygen from the global press.""

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to an external variable, for example, if a stablecoin is pegged to the Indian rupee with 1:1 parity, this would mean that the value of one unit of the cryptocurrency shall remain Rs 1 and will not change with market volatility. The stablecoin intends to replace fiat currencies like the US dollar, the Russian ruble, or the Iranian rial, for cross-border transactions.

The actual numbers are likely higher. The government has provided zero evidence to back up its claims about what happened at the prison, which is why we are not reporting their statements right now.

Today families of prisoners in Evin gathered outside the prison, as shown in this video. 

Since last night, some prisoners, including some political prisoners, were able to call their families to let them know their condition, but the prison has a capacity of 15,000 and could be over-capacity due to the high influx of protesters who were sent there in the past four weeks—this means thousands of families are potentially still waiting for information about their loved ones.

Prisoners in the women’s ward were reportedly attacked last night with tear gas, tweeted former political prisoner Atena Daemi while referencing her source inside the prison. Her tweets below have been translated into English by the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI):  “From a prisoner in the Women’s Ward: The siren was heard from 8:30 last night. Mohammadi, head of security, and Hayat-Algheib, head of State Prisons Organization, came to Evin Prison. [Inmates] broke the door and entered the outer area of the ward. Then they brought a sniper.” 

Follow up tweet: “Profanity was said. Prisoners without hijab chanted death to the dictator. They fired a lot of tear gas; some are still having lung problems today. Then [inmates] were guided inside the prison. At the moment everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”

There were more protests in Iran today, five weeks after Mahsa Amini, 22, was pronounced dead just days after she was arrested by the morality police.

At Tehran University today protesters chanted, “Tehran has become a prison! Evin has become a slaughterhouse!”

protesting.

Internet and mobile services have also been restricted in neighbourhoods amidst the crackdowns. According to NetBlocks (Via Twitter) Iran is now subject to the most
'severe internet restrictions' since November 2019 with Whatsapp and Instagram now being blocked.

Both journalists are in great danger given Iranian intelligence agencies' cowardly attempts to pin the country's anti-state protests, which the Raisi government has been unable to crush, on the two women.

The intelligence agencies, both with documented histories of torturing and killing targets of the state, offered no evidence to justify their slander and incorrectly claimed that Niloufar had tweeted a photo of Mahsa Zhina Amini in the hospital, when she had only tweeted a photo of Amini's parents embracing in grief. Elahe, meanwhile, is being persecuted for reporting on Amini's funeral in Saqqez, Kurdistan province. In summary, these women journalists are being attacked for doing their jobs as journalists, which is legal even under the laws of the Islamic Republic.

""Do not come to the streets! Today is the last day of the riots,"" Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami said in some of the toughest language used in the crisis, which Iran's leaders blame on its foreign enemies including Israel and the United States. ⁠

⁠
iran has been gripped by protests since the death of 22-year-old kurdish woman mahsa amini in the custody of the morality police last month, posing one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution. ⁠
⁠
""do not come to the streets! today is the last day of the riots,"" revolutionary guards commander hossein salami said in some of the toughest language used in the crisis, which iran's leaders blame on its foreign enemies including israel and the united states. ⁠

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others
 
1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out
Use these tags when you post
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran
To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as
#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics etc. get creative!

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented

4. Organize to support iranians where you live 
Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country. DISCLAIMER: Due to sanctions against Iran, it is illegal to fundraise to send money there legally. If you see people collecting funds, be weary",,,,684,1.78,"@the.wellness.therapist :

Binance said late Thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB
 tokens off the network. So-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.

The company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on BSC, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.

Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

“An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC,” Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, said in a tweet Thursday evening.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”

BNB Chain has since resumed operations.

In total, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, Binance’s BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.

The hack was caused by a bug in the bridge’s smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm Immunefi. Smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.

The value of BNB sank more than 3% Friday morning to $285.36 a coin, according to CoinMarketCap data.

An earlier estimate from the company placed the total amount withdrawn in a range of $100 million to $110 million. The company also said it managed to freeze $7 million of funds with the help of its security partners.

A Binance spokesperson told CNBC the company coordinated with BNB Chain validators to enact an upgrade. That meant that most of the funds remained in the exploiter’s crypto wallet, while about $100 million was “unrecovered.”

When you share about people being held in prison in Iran, specifically by name, you are helping save their life. 
Fame buys safety.

On Nov 24, the UN Human Rights Council @unitednationshumanrights voted for a Fact-Finding Mission, into examining the human rights abuses In
Iran. This puts even more pressure on the
regime to portray a good image internationally.
Since the UN vote, the regime in recent days has released hundreds of detainees like Katayoun Mahmoudifar. Some of these released detainees include a prominent human rights activist, a famous 
actress and two former footballers among others. 
Posting on social media is the BEST way to help! 
Iranians are begging us to keep posting so that the regime is put under pressure. The Islamic Regime of Iran knows the world is watching, and is afraid of being held accountable.

One of the slides has a TW. While it may feel overwhelming to read; please remember that it is reality for many Iranians. Turning our eyes away from their pain, is invalidating their suffering. When we are aware, we are able to amplify better. 

Reach out to Iranians you know in your community. All of them are undergoing severe mental distress. Send them love, strength and solidarity. Ask how you can support them better. Share posts that they are sharing & stand united with them.

There is nothing as isolating than to have your yoga teacher or fellow practitioner invalidate what you, or the people in your country are going through. If you are a non-Iranian reach out to your yoga teacher and ask him/her to share. 
Stand in Solidarity. 

Simultaneously, do stand in solidarity with people from across the world facing war, protests, oppression, systemic violence, ethnic cleansing, genocide, gender/religious/race & caste based violence, climate events…

Her family was informed of her death ten days later.
The late teenager’s family were not allowed to see the body and were only allowed to look at her face for a few seconds for identification purposes.
Shakarami’s mother and aunt saw that her nose had been smashed and her skull was broken. The official death certificate cited “multiple blows caused by a hard object” as the cause of death.
The death of the teenager enraged citizens and led to high school girls joining the anti-government protests in large numbers on October 4.
The Iranian authorities claimed she died due to falling from a height, however, Shakarami’s mother Nasrin accused the Iranian authorities of murdering her daughter and pressuring her to say that she died by suicide after she jumped from the roof of a building.
Her family planned to bury Shakarami in Khorramabad, on October 2, which would have been her 17th birthday. However, they alleged that the security forces pressured them into not holding a funeral service.
Reportedly, the late teenager’s aunt, Atash Shakarami, defied the security forces and posted about the funeral on Twitter and invited people to join the celebration of her niece’s “last birthday”. Shortly afterwards, she and her husband were arrested.
On October 5, Iranian state television aired interviews where Atash stated that the teenager fell from the roof. The interview was reportedly filmed while they were in government custody. Shakarami’s mother also claimed that her sister was “forced to make the confession and broadcast them”.
Her family further alleged that Shakarami’s body was stolen and buried in Hayat Ol Gheyb to prevent publicity and prevent her grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for protesters.

⁠
👉The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards warned protesters that Saturday would be their last day of taking to the streets, in the clearest sign that security forces may intensify their fierce crackdown on nationwide unrest. ⁠
⁠
Since the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police last month, Iran has been gripped by protests, posing one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution. ⁠
⁠
""Do not come to the streets! Today is the last day of the riots,"" Guards commander Hossein Salami said in some of the toughest language used in the crisis, which Iran's leaders blame on its foreign enemies including Israel and the United States. ⁠
⁠
""This sinister plan, is a plan hatched ... in the White House and the Zionist regime,"" Salami said. ""Don't sell your honor to America and don't slap the security forces who are defending you in the face."" ⁠
⁠
Iranians have defied such warnings throughout the popular revolt, in which women have played a prominent role. There were more reports of fresh bloodshed and renewed protests on Saturday. ⁠
⁠
Human rights group Hengaw reported security forces shooting students at a girls school in the city of Saqez. In another post, it said security forces opened fire on students at Kurdistan University of Medical Science, in the Kurdistan provincial capital of Sanandaj. ⁠

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by refusing to wear the hijab & peacefully protesting. The Islamic Republic of Iran regime has shut down their connection to the outside world. They’re being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories since they cannot. 

Iranians are asking for those on the outside to be their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain.

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians.

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as: 

#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics . get creative! 

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented. 

4. Organize to support iranians where you live  Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country.",,,,480,-17.1,"follow @_the.wellness.therapist for up-to-date info on what’s happening in iran (as well as a lot of other great info)

“All across Iran, protesters have been risking their lives to call for an end to the Islamic Republic’s violent repression,” said Ghaemi.

“The state’s attempts to crush peaceful protest through killings, arrests, and imprisonment is a prelude to more severe state violence against Iran’s citizenry, which can only be halted through strong, collective, international action,” he said.

* CHRI calls on the Islamic Republic to release a public accounting of all political prisoners and detainees and their whereabouts, as well as a public listing of all those who have been killed since September 16, 2022, when anti-state protests erupted in the country.

* CHRI also urges the international community, including government leaders, the UN, and bar associations across the world, to call on the government in Iran to release all detained protesters and political prisoners and halt its crackdown on peaceful dissent.

* The U.S. and its partners should also pursue the establishment of an urgent special session at the U.N. Human Rights Council so that governments can collectively address the violence against protesters and establish an investigative, reporting, and accountability mechanism for the Islamic Republic’s many serious crimes.

Protestors are reportedly chopping their hair, burning down the hijab, and dressing up as men to oppose the moral policing of police and the system. 
On social media, videos of Iranian women cutting their hair and burning their hijabs are spreading amid growing outrage. Iranian protesters also took to the streets with antigovernmental slogans at a gathering in Saqez, Amini’s hometown. The crowd came from nearing cities in Kurdistan province. The protestors raised slogans like Death to the dictator – a reference to Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while some women threw their headscarves. 
Videos shared on social media also showed protesters assembling near the University of Tehran. The crowd raised slogans like Woman, Life, Freedom. Thousands of Iranian women staged protest rallies in the capital on weekend. Police fired tear gas shells to resist the protest. 
The death of Amini in the custody of morality police has forced women to take to the streets in protest and put a spotlight on their repression. 
Amini died on 16 September, Friday after being detained by the police unit liable for enforcing the Islamic republic’s strict dress code for women. Reports say that she fell into a coma post-arrest in Tehran. Media reports stated a heart attack as a reason after being detained by the morality police.
Reportedly, Amini was thrashed by police when they detained her in the police van. However, police have denied the allegations, saying Amini had “suddenly suffered a heart problem”. Amini’s family claimed their daughter was perfectly healthy.
Amini’s death erupted the protest, but seeds of distress were already sown due to growing reports of repressive acts against women. Women over the age of seven have to strictly cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes as per Iran’s sharia law. 
President Ebrahim Raisi passed an order on July 5, to enforce the hijab law, which carved a new list of restrictions on how women can dress.

🎙️ Alidoosti had criticised international organisations for not speaking out against the execution, on Instagram. Watching this bloodshed and not taking action, is a disgrace to humanity,” she wrote.

🇮🇷 Iran arrested her for spreading falsehoods/making claims without any supporting documents. 

❗️ Alidoosti’s Instagram account, which had eight million followers, has been suspended. 

🗓️ Last month, she had posted a her picture without the hijab and held a piece of paper reading “women, life, freedom”, the rallying cry of the current anti-regime protests sweeping the country. 

📌 A TREND: In November, the authorities detained Hengameh Ghaziani and Katayoun Riahi, two other renowned Iranian actors, for expressing solidarity with the protests on social media.

📌 Authorities also arrested Iranian football player Voria Ghafouri last month for “insulting the national soccer team and propagandising against the government”. 

❗️DID YOU KNOW: Courts in and around Tehran have recently sentenced 400 detained protestors to prison sentences of up to 10 years.

#US Soccer sparked uproar over the weekend after posting an Iranian flag without its Islamic Republic emblem on the federation's social media feeds in what it claimed was a gesture of solidarity with Iranian women protesters.

Berhalter told a press conference on Monday that the US players and coaching staff had been oblivious about the posts as he sought to calm tensions surrounding Tuesday's Group B game, where a place in the last 16 is at stake.

""Sometimes things are out of our control,"" Berhalter said. ""We're not focused on those outside things and all we can do is apologize on behalf of the players and the staff, but it's not something that we were a part of.

""We had no idea what US Soccer put out. The staff, the players, we had no idea. For us our focus is on this match and I don't want to sound aloof, or we're not caring by saying that.

""Of course our thoughts are with the Iranian people, the whole country, and everyone. But our thoughts are only on this match.""

Earlier, Iran state media called for the United States to be kicked out of the World Cup after the USA men's national soccer team (USMNT) deleted the emblem of the Islamic Republic in a post displaying upcoming matches in Group B for the World Cup.

The USMNT defended the move by telling CNN that it was to show “support for the women in #Iran fighting for basic human rights” but was never meant to last over 24 hours.

The change “was a one-time graphic,” the soccer federation told CNN. “We have the main flag on our website and other places.”

However, Iran state media said on Twitter that “by posting a distorted image of the flag of the Islamic Republic of #Iran on its official account, the #US football team breached the @FIFAcom charter, for which a 10-game suspension is the appropriate penalty.”

It added, “Team #USA should be kicked out of the #WorldCup2022.”

According to internal documents from the social media company, the campaign will advertise the Starlink satellite internet service, which is owned and operated by SpaceX, on Twitter in Spain and Australia. A Twitter ""takeover"" refers to the advertising campaign SpaceX is purchasing to advertise Starlink. According to two current and two former Twitter employees who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to speak on behalf of the company when a company purchases one of these packages, they typically spend upwards of $250,000 to place their brand at the top of the main Twitter timeline for a full day.

On the day or days of the anticipated takeover campaign in Australia and Spain, users should see Starlink brand messaging the first three times they open the Twitter app. The recently acquired campaign was planned to run in the upcoming days, first in Australia and then in Spain. According to current and past employees, SpaceX has not traditionally acquired significant advertising packages from Twitter.

Starlink uses a constellation of satellites to deliver internet to paying customers, who must also purchase terminals from SpaceX in order to use it.

🩸 Iranian security forces in Zahedan city have killed at least 90 people amid demonstrations against a police officer accused of rape in a separate case. The government has called the protesters “separatists”. 

🥀 Iran's Children's Rights Protection Society says at least 28 children have been killed. 

👉🏼 At least 1,200 people have been arrested, including at least 20 journalists, per Iran Human Rights. 

❗️Iran’s Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi told Iranian media on October 5 that the ""average age of the detainees from many of the recent protests was 15"". 

❗️❗️ In an interview with an independent  Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have been detained and referred to “psychological institutions” to be “reformed”.

CNN reported on Thursday that SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon last month saying it could not continue to fund the Starlink service in Ukraine, and it may have to stop funding it unless the U.S. military gives the company tens of millions of dollars a month. ⁠

He was buried in Farashband City in Fars on Tuesday.

As per IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency), Haji had avoided showering over fears of “getting sick. However, for the first time a few months ago, “villagers had taken him to a bathroom to wash.”

According to New York Post Haji lived in isolation for most of his life in an open brick hut, which villagers made after he started sleeping in a hole in the ground.

Locals attributed Haji’s eccentricity to “emotional setbacks” in his youth. In 2014, the Tehran Times reported that Haji also avoided fresh food, opting instead for rotted porcupine, and smoked a pipe of animal excrement.

Reportedly, a short documentary film titled “The Strange Life of Amou Haji” was made about his life in 2013.

🎤 What we know: The morality police “has nothing to do with the judiciary and has been abolished by the same authorities who installed it.” This quote of the Attorney General Mohammad Javad Montazeri on Dec 3 at a meeting with officials to discuss the unrest, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) was widely reported and interpreted by international and Indian news platforms, including us (post now removed), as Iran’s morality police being disbanded.

📌Since then: Iranians have taken to social media to dismiss this news as disinformation, calling it a throwaway remark that amounts to nothing on the ground, where the the Iranian government continues to suppress protestors through arrests, and violence.

📺 Arab-language Al-Alam state television has said that foreign media were depicting Montazeri’s comments as “a retreat on the part of the Islamic Republic from its stance on hijab and religious morality as a result of the protests”, but  all that could be understood from his comments was that the morality police were not directly related to the judiciary. ""No official of the Islamic Republic of Iran has said that the Guidance Patrol has been shut.""

❓What we don't know: 

👉🏼 If the Attorney General's statement will actually translate into the Morality Police being withdrawn.

👉🏼 Even if the morality police is disbanded, will the government take to other methods of enforcing compliance with Sharia laws?

👉🏼 Even if the morality police is disbanded, will it lead to a change in the strict Sharia laws on how women should dress and behave in public? 

👉🏼 The official stance of the government. Iran's Ministry of Interior is yet to issue a statement. 

🇮🇷 Bottom line: Iranian protestors have dismissed this news as a superficial, half-baked attempt to divert the western media's attention. They say their demands are no longer limited to the disbanding of the morality police, they want a complete regime change.

Our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice.

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as: 

#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics etc. get creative! 

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented. 

4. Organize to support iranians where you live 
Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country. DISCLAIMER: Due to sanctions against Iran, it is illegal to fundraise to send money there legally. If you see people collecting funds, be weary",,,,271,-1.08,"i think this came from @_the.wellness.therapist originally. do read the caption 🙏🏼 #mahsaamini #womanlifefreedom #opiran

“Doctors who’ve spoken out against Islamic Republic forces occupying medical buildings and who are trying to treat wounded protesters are engaging in a courageous defense of the right to life and deserve international solidarity,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“Members of the medical community shouldn’t have to risk their lives to call on authorities to allow them to provide care in a safe environment, yet that’s what’s happening in Iran as we speak,” he added.

“The international medical community should join human rights groups in urgently calling on the Iranian government to allow doctors to protect human life without the threat of death or arbitrary arrest,” said Ghaemi. “And call for the immediate release of all detained medical workers.”

Many people in Iran who’ve been wounded amid the protests are too afraid to go to a hospital for treatment because protesters seeking medical help have been detained, according to several accounts shared with CBS News from both inside and outside Iran.

On October 25, members of the Tehran Medical Council issued a statement condemning state security forces patrolling medical buildings in search of protesters: “As members of the Tehran Medical Council, we condemn the military, police, security, and unidentified forces for entering medical universities and hospitals and demand that they stop.”

The statement also called “for the protection of the detainees and their families.”

“Woman, life, freedom”: It’s been more than a month since Zhina (Mahsa) Amini’s arrest by Iran's ‘morality police’ on September 13th. Three days later she died. Her death marked the beginning of anti-government protests which within days spread over the entire country.

Tomorrow, on Saturday, from 3–8pm, the ""Woman* Life Freedom Kollektiv"" is organising a large protest in Berlin to support the weeks-long resistance across an innumerable number of Iranian cities, standing up against oppression and discrimination in the Islamic Republic.

The Berlin protest will take the following route:

Begin 3pm:
Hofjägerallee (Antreteplatz) - Großer Stern - Spreeweg - John-Foster-Dulles-Allee - Yitzhak-Rabin-Str. - Str. des 17. Juni - Straße des 17. Juni / Großer Stern (Endplatz / ausschließlich Großer Stern)

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Islamic Republic of Iran, Javaid Rehman, will hold a briefing at the UN’s headquarters in New York on Oct. 27 to address the state of human rights in the country.

The conference will take place during the 3,944th meeting of the 136th session of the UN Human Rights Committee (CCPR).

Iran has been shaken  by nationwide protests since Sept. 16, following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Amini was detained by the country’s morality police for breaching the country’s strict female dress code, and died in custody.

Protests began as a show of resistance against Iran’s compulsory hijab laws, then grew into a collective call for regime change. The rallies entered their fifth week on Oct. 23 and now involve women and men; children; ethnic and religious minority communities; and workers.

More than 200 people — including at least 23 children — have been killed by government security forces, according to reports by organizations monitoring the protests.

The announcement of the UN briefing follows an Oct. 17 letter by the world’s leading human rights organizations asking the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session on Iran.

The letter to the UN was signed by 43 human rights groups, including: Human Rights Watch; Amnesty International; Article 19; the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran; the Center for Human Rights in Iran; Iran Human Rights; the Kurdistan Human Rights Network; and the Siamak Pourzand Foundation.

The letter said: “Given the gravity of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed in Iran and the prevailing systemic impunity [the council should establish] an independent, investigative, reporting and accountability mechanism.”",UN EXPERT ON IRAN TO HOLD HUMAN RIGHTS BRIEFING AMID NATIONWIDE PROTESTS Javaid Rehman,,,209,1.94,"by natasha phillips ((@sobukira))

No government should murder, mass arrest, torture and execute its people and no government should escape being held accountable for hundreds of lives it’s taken so far. The torture, to obtain forced confession, and sexual violence of those arrested have been reported widely and is a known fact. The UN, along with dozens of respectable Human Rights Organisations including Amnesty International, have exposed the brutal methods the IRI uses to suppress any protests and cry for basic freedom. I am worried that the Iranian regime is going to murder and execute more innocent people, therefore, I am announcing my political sponsorship of two young people accused of the vague and dubious crimes of “Moharebeh” or “Waging war against God” and “spreading corruption on earth” punishable by death. #ShirinMarashi and #BahmanBahmani. These are made up charges to intimidate and silence those who are opposing the regime. I will talk about them in my next two posts.

Footage circulating on social media suggests that protests following #Mahsah_Amini 's death have occurred in 19 of #Iran's 31 provinces within the past three days.

Protests that were initially concentrated in #Tehran City and throughout #Kurdistan Province – where Amini was from – have since spread nationwide within the past day, reaching historically conservative cities like #Qom 

Protestors have chanted anti-regime slogans against mandatory veiling and against Supreme Leader #Khamenei 's son, #Mojtaba , who some have speculated will succeed his father as #SupremeLeader 

Iranian social media users reported arrests, violence, and severe internet outages and disruptions in cities like #Sanandaj Kurdistan Province and #Tehran City in response to recent unrest.

The regime has deployed its anti-riot units to crack down on unrest, but has not yet mobilized the #IRGC Ground Forces as it did in 2019.

The hard fork — a blockchain upgrade that implements a major change to the network's underlying software — went through successfully at 4 a.m. ET on Wednesday at a block height of 22,107,423. It was mainly executed to implement a software patch that resolved a critical vulnerability exploited by an unknown attacker to steal more than $100 million from BNB Chain's cross-chain bridge last Friday.

The developer team announced the upgrade with a GitHub post on Tuesday, saying it would carry out a hard fork to deploy a patch and re-enable the network's “cross-chain infrastructure.”

This cross-chain bridge allows users to transfer assets between the two separate blockchains that fall under the BNB Chain network: Beacon Chain and Smart Chain. While BNB Beacon Chain handles the network's governance and staking, the Smart Chain is used as an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible smart contract platform to deploy apps. Both of these chains can connect to other third-party chains with the help of Token Hub bridge as well.

During the exploit, the perpetrator forged security proofs, leveraging a vulnerability tied to ""iavl hash check,"" a security check baked into the bridge. In this way, the hacker was able to mint 2 million BNB tokens out of thin air, worth around $560 million at the time. On-chain data shows that the hacker transferred more than $100 million out to third-party chains including Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum. The majority of the affected assets (nearly $430 million) remained in the hacker's wallet on the BNB Chain itself.

Posted @withrepost • @officiallyjoko Niloufar Hamedi, a Shargh newspaper journalist, is the journalist who for the first time reported the death of #MahsaAmini and her family’s words from inside Kasra Hospital in Tehran. She has been in detention since Sept 21, 2022. Elaheh Mohammadi, a Mihan newspaper journalist, is also another reporter in detention for going to Saqqez to investigate and report on Mahsa’s funeral.

Today, the Intelligence Ministry of the Islamic Republic and the Intelligence Service of IRGC published a joint-statement about recent protests in Iran and officially accused Niloufar and Elaheh to help the “foreign media” to propagate a biased narrative of what happened around Mahsa’a death. They were accused of doing so by publishing photos of her on the hospital bed (which showed head trauma) and reports of her funeral in Saqqez and people’s protest after that. In the statement, they claim that the two reporters has been trained on foreign soil to work for “the US mafia-like regime”.

Several FTX workers acknowledged on Twitter to sleuth ZachXBT that they were unaware of the transfers.

FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller tweeted that the exchange was ""investigating abnormalities with wallet movements"" more than an hour after the alleged hack began.

He later pinned a message in FTX's official Telegram support channel that read: ""FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don’t go on FTX site as it might download Trojans.""

Throughout the chaos, the official FTX Twitter account was silent.

Miller's Twitter account posted a statement from FTX CEO John Jay Ray III on the afternoon of Nov. 12, confirming the hack and stating that company officials were in contact with law enforcement.

According to Bloomberg, the criminal probe is separate from the fraud case against ousted former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

The report further stated that officials were able to freeze a portion of the stolen money. @benzinga

AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 27 (Reuters) – The United States Soccer Federation temporarily displayed Iran‘s national flag on social media without the emblem of the Islamic Republic as a show of solidarity with protesters in Iran ahead of the two teams’ World Cup clash on Tuesday.

A now-deleted graphic of the Group B standings posted on Saturday across U.S. Soccer’s official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts displayed a plain green, white and red flag.

Iran has been gripped by protests since 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death in September while in police custody after her arrest for flouting the country’s strict Islamic dress code.

The intent of the posts was to “support for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights”, U.S. Soccer media officer Michael Kammarman told a news conference on Sunday. Players were not consulted on the decision to alter the flag.

The banner on U.S. Soccer’s Twitter page was also changed on Saturday to feature the flag without the emblem. It was changed back 24 hours later to the banner they had been using during the tournament.

Iran‘s state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency said the Iranian Football Federation will file a complaint against U.S. Soccer to the FIFA Ethics Committee for “disrespecting the national flag” of the Islamic Republic.

Iranian leaders have accused the United States and other foreign adversaries of fomenting the protests in which Iranians from all walks of life have mounted one of the boldest challenges to the theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Washington has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials over the crackdown on protesters.

The United States and Iran will face off in a decisive Group B clash with their place at the World Cup on the line, in a match which was already freighted by decades of emnity between the nations.

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as:

3. No war. No western intervention.

The post that went viral 2 days ago + attracted the support of celebrities which was swiftly labeled as “fake news” is not fake.

Western media, which for 2 months has largely ignored, underreported or consciously created misinformation by supporting the narrative of the Islamic Republic over the voice of Iranian people, decided to play what’s best called “semantics gymnastics”. [Read that term on a post from the inestimable @smohyeddin, captures the essence of this Western media foolishness.]

Tap through these slides to understand. The IRI has mass executed thousands before. That level of brutality & terror is how they have held Iran hostage for 43+ years.

They currently have imprisoned MORE than 15,000 innocent people whose status is largely unknown because they don’t provide clear info. We don’t even know if some of these people have already been executed. Even after they murder people, they are known to keep their corpses from their family + promise to return the corpse if the family lies about the cause of death (“heart attack”, “suicide”, etc.) when they have been beaten to death by the IRI.

I and others have been saying the IRI will launch psychological + cyber warfare on us as we pull their heinous regime down. They want to distract us. This is all part of that.

Since when has Meta acted so swiftly over “fake news”? In less than 12 hours, posts shared by celebrities w/enormous followings were pulled. How come Meta didn’t challenge the actual fake news of the IRI stating Mahsa Amini’s death was due to a medical condition?

Listen to the people of Iran, not to Western, corporate-controlled media outlets who have their own agendas that rarely support actual human rights. We are telling you the reality of what is + has been happening in Iran for decades. This is a WOMAN-LED, intersectional, INCLUSIVE REVOLUTION and so-called feminist and progressive/liberal orgs in the West are ignoring or diminishing it.

western media, which for 2 months has largely ignored, underreported or consciously created misinformation by supporting the narrative of the islamic republic over the voice of iranian people, decided to play what’s best called “semantics gymnastics”. [read that term on a post from the inestimable @smohyeddin, captures the essence of this western media foolishness.]

tap through these slides to understand. the iri has mass executed thousands before. that level of brutality & terror is how they have held iran hostage for 43+ years.

they currently have imprisoned more than 15,000 innocent people whose status is largely unknown because they don’t provide clear info. we don’t even know if some of these people have already been executed. even after they murder people, they are known to keep their corpses from their family + promise to return the corpse if the family lies about the cause of death (“heart attack”, “suicide”, etc.) when they have been beaten to death by the iri.

i and others have been saying the iri will launch psychological + cyber warfare on us as we pull their heinous regime down. they want to distract us. this is all part of that.

since when has meta acted so swiftly over “fake news”? in less than 12 hours, posts shared by celebrities w/enormous followings were pulled. how come meta didn’t challenge the actual fake news of the iri stating mahsa amini’s death was due to a medical condition?

listen to the people of iran, not to western, corporate-controlled media outlets who have their own agendas that rarely support actual human rights. we are telling you the reality of what is + has been happening in iran for decades. this is a woman-led, intersectional, inclusive revolution and so-called feminist and progressive/liberal orgs in the west are ignoring or diminishing it.

iranians across all socioeconomic levels, of all ethnic + religious backgrounds are united in our goal of eradicating the islamic republic. please share.

Around the world women are uniting in protest against the Iranian government by cutting their hair. The protests started after the death of Mahsa Amini who was arrested by Iranian morality police.

Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman from the Kurdish minority, was arrested on 13 September for what was perceived to be “improper” hijab. She fell into a coma shortly after collapsing at Vozara Detention Centre. Amini died three days later. There are reports Amini was beaten on the head with a baton, and her head was banged against a vehicle by the so-called morality police. 

In recent months, the morality police have expanded street patrols, subjecting women perceived to be wearing “loose hijab” to verbal and physical harassment and arrest. Thousands have taken to the streets in a number of cities across the country. Women are uniting in protest against the Iranian government by cutting their hair.

In Iraqi #Kurdistan, freelance journalist Niyaz Abdullah @niyazabdulla faces legal harassment by security forces and local authorities, and she was detained and threatened with violence over her work. In 2021, she fled to France to escape threats against her.

In #Cuba, freelance journalist Abraham Jiménez Enoa @jimenezenoa was strip-searched and handcuffed, interrogated for five hours, and both he and his family threatened over his writings in October 2020. Cuban authorities’ threats of legal repercussions if he continued to publish, persistent harassment, and censorship forced Jiménez to flee to #Spain in 2021, where he is currently living in exile.

In #Ukraine, despite the dangers of war, death threats, and Russia’s declared ban on her publication, @ukr_pravda’s Editor-in-Chief, Sevgil Musaieva @sevvvgil, has worked relentlessly since the invasion to ensure the safety of her staff and to inform the public.

In #Vietnam, human rights reporter Pham Doan Trang, who also founded the independent legal magazine @luatkhoatapchi, is currently serving a nine-year sentence after a one-day trial on charges of making or spreading news against the state.

CPJ will also honor Russian journalist Galina Timchenko, editor of the independent news website @meduza_en, which she founded in 2014 after fleeing to Latvia.

What Happened: Details of the hacking were shared by Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of Israeli cybersecurity monitoring firm Hudson Rock in a LinkedIn post, first noted on Reuters.

Gal said the leaked email database was “circulating heavily"" and contains ""235,000,000 unique records of Twitter users, and their email addresses and will, unfortunately, lead to a lot of hacking, targeted phishing, and doxxing.""

Widespread anti-government demonstrations erupted in September after the death of young Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who had been detained by morality police for allegedly flouting the strict dress code imposed on women.
“We ask the judiciary to deal decisively with the perpetrators of these crimes and with all those who assisted in the crimes and provoked rioters,” 227 lawmakers from Iran’s 290-seat, hardline-led parliament said in a statement, according to state media.

The activist HRANA news agency said that 318 protesters had been killed in the unrest as of Saturday, including 49 minors. Thirty-eight members of the security forces had also been killed, it added.

State media said last month that more than 46 security forces, including police, had been killed. Government officials have not provided an estimate of any wider death count.

Iranian leaders have vowed tough action against protesters they have described as rioters, accusing enemies including the United States of fomenting the unrest.

Demonstrations continued in many cities on Sunday, from Tehran to the central city of Yazd and the northern city of Rasht, according to rights groups and videos on social media.

A video posted on Twitter showed protesters in southern Tehran after nightfall chanting: “Clerics get lost”.

Reuters could not verify the rights groups’ reports independently, or the social media posts and footage.

DUBAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) – Iranian security forces intensified a crackdown on anti-government protests in several Kurdish cities on Monday, as demonstrations elsewhere in Iran spread into the country’s vital energy sector.
Protests have swept Iran since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iran‘s Kurdish region, died on Sept. 16 while being held for “inappropriate attire”, marking one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.

While university students have played a pivotal role in the protests with dozens of universities on strike, unconfirmed reports on social media showed workers at Abadan and Kangan oil refineries and the Bushehr Petrochemical Project had joined in.

Iran‘s oil ministry was not immediately available to comment.

A combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and Bazaar merchants helped to sweep the clergy to power in the Iranian revolution four decades ago.

With U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran‘s oil exports over the country’s nuclear programme, analyst Karim Sadjadpour said large and sustained strikes among energy workers could bring the Islamic Republic to its knees.

“Iran is less dependent on oil as a percentage of GDP than they were in 1978, but energy exports are still the lifeblood of the economy,” said Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

China, Iran‘s biggest oil customer, is one of the few countries that continues to do business with Iran despite sanctions. But an oil workers’ strike, experts say, could mean there would be no oil to export, legally or illegally.

protests have swept iran since mahsa amini, a 22-year-old from iran‘s kurdish region, died on sept. 16 while being held for “inappropriate attire”, marking one of the boldest challenges to the islamic republic since the 1979 revolution.

while university students have played a pivotal role in the protests with dozens of universities on strike, unconfirmed reports on social media showed workers at abadan and kangan oil refineries and the bushehr petrochemical project had joined in.

iran‘s oil ministry was not immediately available to comment.

a combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and bazaar merchants helped to sweep the clergy to power in the iranian revolution four decades ago.

with u.s. sanctions imposed on iran‘s oil exports over the country’s nuclear programme, analyst karim sadjadpour said large and sustained strikes among energy workers could bring the islamic republic to its knees.

“iran is less dependent on oil as a percentage of gdp than they were in 1978, but energy exports are still the lifeblood of the economy,” said sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace.

china, iran‘s biggest oil customer, is one of the few countries that continues to do business with iran despite sanctions. but an oil workers’ strike, experts say, could mean there would be no oil to export, legally or illegally.

Women have no rights over their bodies, what they wear or what they do. You can’t hold hands with your loved ones, you can’t show your hair, you can’t wear sandals and show your toes. The list goes on. Violation of women’s rights in Iran is at catastrophic levels. The death of #mahsaamini for the simple reason of a few strands of her hair showing under her scarf MUST be the last straw.

Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday. Under duress the family agreed not to hold a funeral but security forces ""stole"" Nika's body from Khorramabad and buried it in the village of Veysian.

Protests have swept through the Islamic Republic for weeks following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by ""morality police"" and taken to a ""re-education center,"" allegedly for not abiding by the country's conservative dress code.

The ""unabated violent response of security forces"" in the country has led to the reported deaths of at least 277 people, Rehman added in an address to the UN Security Council, a figure backed by reports from human rights groups.

However, precise figures are impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm - and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists, reported CNN.

Rehman also referenced Iran's decision to hold public trials for 1,000 people arrested in connection to the ongoing protests, noting that some of the charges carry the death penalty.

Iranian state media - a mouthpiece for the government - has itself reported on the 1,000 or so people indicted in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in nationwide protests, reported CNN.

AL RAYYAN, Doha, Nov 25 (Reuters) – Iran’s coach and players put their stunning World Cup turnaround on Friday down to winning their own mental battles, amid growing public pressure on them to make a stand over a deadly crackdown on protests against their country’s clerical rulers.

Iran were headed for a goalless draw against Wales in Al Rayyan on Friday but scored twice deep in stoppage time to seal a last-gasp victory and keep alive their hopes of reaching the World Cup second round for the first time ever.

The preparations of Team Melli, a huge source of national pride, have been disrupted by a crisis back home following the death in police custody of a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman in September. Her death sparked protests that have grown to represent the boldest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran’s clerical elite since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

al rayyan, doha, nov 25 (reuters) – iran’s coach and players put their stunning world cup turnaround on friday down to winning their own mental battles, amid growing public pressure on them to make a stand over a deadly crackdown on protests against their country’s clerical rulers.

iran were headed for a goalless draw against wales in al rayyan on friday but scored twice deep in stoppage time to seal a last-gasp victory and keep alive their hopes of reaching the world cup second round for the first time ever.

the preparations of team melli, a huge source of national pride, have been disrupted by a crisis back home following the death in police custody of a 22-year-old kurdish-iranian woman in september. her death sparked protests that have grown to represent the boldest challenge to the legitimacy of iran’s clerical elite since the 1979 islamic revolution.

“we talk about the players, their goals. i don’t have words to congratulate my players, they were brilliant,” coach carlos queiroz told a news conference.

In a video statement shared by her brother prior to her arrest, Farideh Moradkhani, a well-known rights activist, asked the leaders of other nations “stop any dealings with this regime”.

""O free people, be with us and tell your governments to stop supporting this murderous and child-killing regime,"" Ms Moradkhani said in the video. ""This regime is not loyal to any of its religious principles and does not know any rules except force and maintaining power.""

“Now in this critical moment in history, all of humanity is observing that Iranian people, with empty hands, with exemplary courage and bravery are fighting with the evil forces,” she said. “At this point in time, the people of Iran are carrying the burden of this heavy responsibility alone by paying with their lives.”

Mr Khamenei’s office has not issued a statement so far.

Her brother, Mahmoud Moradkhani, who presents himself as “an opponent of the Islamic Republic” on Twitter, reported on 23 November that Ms Moradkhani was arrested as she was heeding a court order to appear at the Tehran prosecutor’s office.

According to the activist website Hrana, she was taken to Tehran’s Evin security prison and faces a 15-year prison sentence on unspecified charges.

Her father, Ali Moradkhani Arangeh, was a Shi’ite cleric married to Mr Khamenei’s sister and recently passed away in Tehran following years of isolation due to his stance against the Islamic Republic, according to his website.

Iran has been observing a series of protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, after she was arrested for inappropriate attire. The demonstrators are now posing one of the strongest challenges to the country’s clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

We are writing to raise our deep concerns about the Iranian authorities’ mobilization of their well-honed machinery of repression to ruthlessly crackdown on current nationwide protests.

The United Nations Human Rights Council should act as a matter of urgency by holding a special session and — given the gravity of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed in Iran and the prevailing systemic impunity — establish an independent, investigative, reporting and accountability mechanism.

The recent protests were sparked by outrage at the death in custody of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22 year old woman from the Kurdish minority, on 16 September 2022 days after being arrested by the “morality” police for not complying with the country’s discriminatory and abusive compulsory veiling laws, which perpetuate violence against women and girls in Iran and strip them of their right to dignity and bodily autonomy. The focus of the protests has since quickly expanded to broader grievances and encompassed demands for fundamental political and social change towards protection and fulfilment of human rights.

Evidence gathered by a number of the undersigned organizations shows a harrowing pattern of Iranian security forces deliberately and unlawfully firing live ammunition and metal pellets, including birdshot, at protesters and bystanders including children. Undersigned organizations are documenting growing numbers of protesters and bystanders killed, with some already reporting over 200 deaths, including at least 23 identified children, in Sistan and Baluchistan, Kurdistan and other provinces throughout Iran, as well as hundreds of others injured to date in the ongoing crackdown. The actual numbers, though, are likely to be much higher and growing. Since 18 September 2022, over one thousand protesters, human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists, university students and school children have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, some already charged with “acting against national security.”",IRAN: UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL SHOULD ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM ONG ORATE,,,67,-1.75,"17/10/2022

the recent protests were sparked by outrage at the death in custody of mahsa (jina) amini, a 22 year old woman from the kurdish minority, on 16 september 2022 days after being arrested by the “morality” police for not complying with the country’s discriminatory and abusive compulsory veiling laws, which perpetuate violence against women and girls in iran and strip them of their right to dignity and bodily autonomy. the focus of the protests has since quickly expanded to broader grievances and encompassed demands for fundamental political and social change towards protection and fulfilment of human rights.

evidence gathered by a number of the undersigned organizations shows a harrowing pattern of iranian security forces deliberately and unlawfully firing live ammunition and metal pellets, including birdshot, at protesters and bystanders including children. undersigned organizations are documenting growing numbers of protesters and bystanders killed, with some already reporting over 200 deaths, including at least 23 identified children, in sistan and baluchistan, kurdistan and other provinces throughout iran, as well as hundreds of others injured to date in the ongoing crackdown. the actual numbers, though, are likely to be much higher and growing. since 18 september 2022, over one thousand protesters, human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists, university students and school children have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, some already charged with “acting against national security.”",True,reporting and account

Iranian media and a local prosecutor said four people were killed in the last two days, bringing the total death toll according to official sources to eight, including a member of the police and a pro-government militia member. 

The demonstrations erupted over the death in detention last week of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iranian Kurdistan who was arrested in Tehran for “unsuitable attire”.

The protests, which were concentrated in Iran’s Kurdish-populated north-western regions but have spread to at least 50 cities and towns nationwide, are the largest since a wave of demonstrations in 2019 over gasoline price rises.

Reports from Kurdish rights group Hengaw, which Reuters could not verify, said 10 protesters had been killed. Three died on Wednesday, adding to the seven people the group said had been killed by security forces. 

Officials have denied that security forces have killed protesters, suggesting they may have been shot by armed dissidents.

With no sign of the protests easing, authorities restricted access to the internet, according to accounts from Hengaw, residents, and internet shutdown observatory NetBlocks. 

Activists expressed concern that the internet shutdown echoed a government move before a crackdown against the 2019 fuel price protests, when Reuters reported that 1,500 people were killed.

NetBlocks and residents said access had been restricted to Instagram – the only major social media platform that Iran usually allows and which has millions of users – and that some mobile phone networks had been shut down. 

“Iran is now subject to the most severe Internet restrictions since the November 2019 massacre,” NetBlocks said. 

Amini’s death unleashed anger over issues including freedoms in the Islamic Republic and an economy reeling from sanctions.

Women have waved and burnt their veils during protests, with some cutting their hair in public.

Pleasant woman accused of engaging in a sophisticated catfishing campaign of harassment that targeted two teens one of them her own daughter, was charged with five crimes, including one that accused her of attempting to frame another student.

The 42-year-old Kendra Gail Licari, was charged Monday afternoon with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit a crim£ and one count of obstruction of justice. 

The obstruction charge alleges that Licari attempted to frame another minor for her actions during the investigation.

Licari was arrested Monday after an investigation that started with a report to officials with the Beal City Schools of a cyberbullying complaint involving Licari’s daughter and the boy she was seeing at the time. Licari’s daughter attends Beal City Schools.

Licari and the mother of the other student worked with school officials to figure out the source of the harassment, David Barberi, Isabella County Prosecutor, said Monday.

Licari is accused of having used virtual private networks to mask the location she was sending messages from, Barberi said. When kids the age of the two traveled, she made it appear as if the messages were coming from the location they were at.

(Swipe For Back Up Story)

 A few said that the d€ath penalty was 'imposed' on 15000, the false claims started floating on social media platforms after human rights groups estimated that 15000 protestors were detained in Iran over the protests that followed the d€ath of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, who was detained by Iran's powerful Guidance Patrol or morality police, for not wearing hijab.

Amini di€d under mysterious circumstances triggering nationwide protests against the government. 

Following the reports by human rights organizations, many celebrities and even government officials from some countries expressed dismay over the 'imposition' of d€ath penlty on Iranian protestors.

Celebrities such as Peter Frampton ,Nigerian celebrities and host of others who didn’t verify before sharing has fueled the false narrative that Iran sentences 15,000 protestors to d€ath as a 'hard lesson' for all rebels.

However only one Iranian protester was sentenced to d€ath on 13 Nov 2022, for setting fire to a government building, disturbing public order, conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, waging war against God and corruption on earth', one of the most serious offences under Iranian law, the judiciary's Mizan Online website reported. 

This is the first known use of capital punishment for participation in an anti-regime 'riot'. 

The sentence is the latest attempt by the Iranian government to suppress the protests which have swept the country since the death of 22-year-old.

Another court in Tehran sentenced five others to prison terms of between five and ten years for 'gathering and conspiring to commit crimes against national security and disturbing public order'.

The United Nations Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Nov. 24 to address “the deteriorating human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to a council press release. The meeting is the first of its kind on Iran.

Special sessions at the UN are held to discuss important topics. They are considered high-level events, and involve heads of state and government as well as cabinet ministers. Proposed sessions can only be approved if they have the support of one-third of the 47 members of the council.

The decision to hold the meeting comes after a Nov. 11 request by Germany and Iceland. The resolution has been supported by 44 member states so far, as well as 27 supporter states including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The list of signatories remains open until the session takes place, enabling additional states to support it in the days leading up to the meeting.

The meeting comes after an Oct. 27 briefing by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Islamic Republic of Iran, Javaid Rehman at the UN headquarters that addressed human rights violations in the country during the recent protests.

Demonstrations erupted in mid-September in Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while she was in the custody of the country’s morality police. The protests, which have now gone on for more than 60 days, have turned into a countrywide call for regime change, led by women, men, and children; ethnic and religious minorities; and oil and factory workers.

During the 30-minute briefing on Oct. 27, Rehman said Amini was “a victim of state brutality and state repression,” and that protesters were “seeking justice. They are seeking accountability.” Rehman confirmed that the UN had received several reports of women and children killed by state authorities in Iran and that the international community had a responsibility to address allegations of human rights violations by Iran’s regime.",UN Human Rights Council to Hold First-Ever First- Special Session on Iran บา,,,44,-1.82,"by natasha phillips

This also made movements durable, instilling discipline and chains of command. Social media allows would-be protesters to skip those steps… Without that traditional activist infrastructure, social media protests are less equipped to endure government repression… ‘We live in an age of digital authoritarianism’... Dictatorships, seizing on the internet and other tools, have developed new methods from direct surveillance of activists’ communications to online harassment and intimidation to the rapid diffusion of state propaganda to the infiltration of movements to selective censorship.” End excerpt.

The nationwide protests, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in September in the custody of morality police, have been at their most intense in western provinces where the majority of Iran‘s 10 million Kurds live.

NetBlocks, which tracks connectivity around the world, tweeted that mobile internet was cut off for many users in Iran amid a new wave of protests and reports of casualties.

Several videos shared on social media on Monday showed crowds fleeing live bullets shot by security forces, with footage in the Kurdish-populated city of Javanrud showing people taking cover behind a wall, attending to one injured man and seeking to retrieve the body of a dead protester lying on the street.
Hengaw, a Kurdish Iranian rights group, shared a video on Monday of security forces being dispatched to the Kurdish cities of Mahabad and Bukan in dozens of pickups, motorbikes, police cars and one light armoured vehicle painted black.

Reuters could not verify the videos.

several videos shared on social media on monday showed crowds fleeing live bullets shot by security forces, with footage in the kurdish-populated city of javanrud showing people taking cover behind a wall, attending to one injured man and seeking to retrieve the body of a dead protester lying on the street.
hengaw, a kurdish iranian rights group, shared a video on monday of security forces being dispatched to the kurdish cities of mahabad and bukan in dozens of pickups, motorbikes, police cars and one light armoured vehicle painted black.

reuters could not verify the videos.

Relations between Riyadh and Washington have deteriorated since OPEC+'s decision to cut oil production by 2 million bpd.

Many lawmakers, some of whom have long advocated cutting ties with the Saudis, reacted with even greater outrage, calling for the immediate withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the kingdom and an end to all arms sales, among other punitive measures.

But the White House, pondering how to fulfill Biden's promise of consequences, and despite its incessant anger, is concerned about the backlash caused by Washington's harsh response. Instead of reacting quickly, he is biding his time and looking for ways to get the Saudis back on track while maintaining strong bilateral security ties.

The White House, which confirmed a Wall Street Journal report on the recent Iranian threat and was on high alert, declined to comment on the launch of U.S. warplanes.

This piece is taken from a music-album that is ongoing-composition, and is now during the pre-order on Noise à Noise, too. “Politics-Aesthetics II: Becketts Quad Variations”. This is the second collection among a few albums with similar titles and numbers in sequence that he has composed, or have planned for composition throughout the next season; similar to the previous album, it is an ongoing project, too. An album that is under development, but won't be pending the release as the pieces are going to gradually appear here on Bandcamp on a weekly basis during the pre-order period. 

Ehsan Saboohi is a composer and music theorist, he considers himself a post-orientalist composer, a term he has coined to describe a music language for analyzing the aesthetics of his and his colleagues’ compositions. He demands a different language of common Contemporary Classical music trends by taking inspiration from the philosophical-social ideas of the famous philosopher Edward Said.
“Post-Orientalism is a modern music language that uses microtonal sounds and intervals alongside altered sound chain and block structures to achieve a post-orientalism musical piece in different acoustic and electroacoustic compositions.”

The facts of Amini’s death have quickly become irrelevant amid the widening fight against police violence, the repressive laws against women, and the disastrous trend in economic conditions.

On the morning of October 10, the workers of the oil sector acted upon their warnings to Tehran and a strike began after workers at the Asaluyeh Complex in the Bushehr province walked out. Hours later they were followed by fellow petroleum workers in Abadan, Khuzestan who went on strike in solidarity. Videos posted on social media show workers chanting ‘This year is the year of blood, Seyed Ali Khamenei is done!’ and ‘Down with the Dictator’ in front of government buildings. Similar videos that show workers chanting ‘Long live Iran! Long live Lurs, Turks, Kurds, Arabs and Bakhtiari’s!’ demonstrate the noble internationalism of the Iranian proletariat. It has been additionally reported that drivers of bitumen tankers have also begun striking, further extending the scope of the opposition. One video shows Iranian government workers being jeered-at by schoolgirls, and 5 leading Iranian economists have criticised the government’s response to the protests.

The workers of Iran are forced into increasing militancy by the repressive laws and policing of the theocratic government. After years of increasing unemployment, repression, immiseration, hunger and thirst, the promises of the ruling clique in Tehran become hollow. But the people still face enormous hurdles. There is not a functioning workers’ party in the country and socialists are heavily oppressed, the masses are therefore directionless. This can be seen by the movement itself, there is no single organisation that leads these people and the protests are therefore overall spontaneous and rudderless. What will inevitably follow is either the increasing repression of these protests, or their co-option towards reform and dissolution.

A facade militia group in Iraq has claimed an attack on a an American convoy today (19/01) in the Yusufiya township of Baghdad. The name of the group that claimed responsibility is Al-Muqawama Al-Duwaliya, or the International Resistance. This is not a real group. Analysts believe that it is a front set up by Harakat H3zbollah al-Nuj4ba, a large(ish) militia with very close ties to Iran.

The organisation claimed the attack at 01:00 local time, 30 minutes after the attack took place. Sabereen News, which is a pan-PMF outlet with IP servers based in Kermanshah, Iran, was the first to report on the attack at 00:37. From that time onwards until today, twitter bots and supporters of the PMF (particularly those fond of HHN) have been spreading this news. 

The United States has not commented, this may be because no attack actually happened. The only traditional media outlets to report on the attack are Iranian funded/ pro-Iran outlets such as ‘iranpress.com’. They may receive orders to publish stories like this.

Whether or not the attack actually happened is actually irrelevant, HHN (or perhaps a different PMF group) have given birth to the idea that an attack happened against a US convoy in Iraq, which for them is a win. HHN and other PMF factions want to be seen as actively confronting the US presence in Iraq. Iraqi trust in traditional media outlets is at an all time low and militias take advantage of this by spreading their disinformation campaigns to build narratives.

""Starlink is losing money"" despite other companies ""getting billions in taxpayer $,"" he complained.

But Musk then followed up the tweet with a more promising message about doing good deeds.

""No good deed goes unpunished,"" one user replied.

Musk answered, ""Even so, we should still do good deeds.""

Musk's tweets seem to suggest that SpaceX will go on funding the satellite internet service used in support of Ukraine during its war with Russia, despite reports earlier this week that SpaceX has asked the Pentagon to take over paying for it.

However, it remains unclear if the aerospace company will continue its efforts.

According to documents obtained by CNN, a September letter from SpaceX to the Pentagon alleged that funding Starlink could cost Musk's aerospace manufacturer nearly $400 million over the next year.

Early Friday morning, Musk tweeted, ""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households.""

""This is unreasonable,"" he added.

His statement echoed SpaceX's letter to the Pentagon, CNN reported.

""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" SpaceX's director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon, according to CNN.

Starlink is a satellite constellation that provides internet connection to regions without stable telecommunications infrastructure, according to international broadcaster Deutsche Welle.

Not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, SpaceX sent thousands of Starlink terminals to Kyiv to allow Ukrainian soldiers and civilians to maintain internet connection. The aid came at the request of Ukraine's digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov during the early months of the war, Insider reported.

This is 16-year-old Nika Shakarami. They had plans to move to Germany with their girlfriend. They loved the color black, Halloween, and anime. Nika loved art and would frequently post their drawings on their Instagram, which has since been deleted by Iranian officials after their involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests.

On September 20th, Nika bravely joined a protest occurring in Tehran and was seen lighting their hijab on fire in response to the mandatory hijab restrictions in Iran. They were chased, cornered, and captured by military personnel before being taken to the infamous Iranian Elvin Prison. Ten days after Nika’s kidnapping, their family was finally informed by the government that they had died due to “falling from a great height.” After IDing their body, their family reportedly stated that the blows to their skull were comparable to injuries sustained from heavy beatings or torture and that they had experienced sexual abuse while in custody. In an effort to silence Nika’s family, Iranian authorities have so far arrested their aunt and uncle and have threatened the rest of their family’s safety. 

Since the murder of Mahsa Amini by the hands of the Iranian military in September, @iranhumanrights reports that at least 476 people have died from militia beatings, gun violence, or state-sanctioned executions. Nika is one of many children who are currently losing their lives fighting for a chance at equality and equity. It is up to us to be the voice that keeps her story alive and continues the work towards freedom for all Iranian women and people.

The hacking was informed to the police. The Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said ""My Facebook page appears to be hacked since today morning. The matter has been reported and efforts are on to restore the page"", a tweet said.

Even after several hours of reporting the incident to the police and the social media platform, the unauthorised posts on Khan's account were yet to be removed.

Khamenei.” This literally translates as “death to Khamenei” but is often used as political rhetoric to mean “down with Khamenei.” 

In the Iranian context, the Board finds that Meta must do more to respect freedom of expression, and permit the use of rhetorical threats. The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. In such situations, it is vital that Meta supports users’ voice. 

The content in this case was posted days before Iran’s “National Day of Hijab and Chastity"". Given the national day was approaching, Meta should have anticipated issues around the over-removal of Iranian protest content, and prepared an adequate response. For example, by instructing “at-scale” reviewers not to remove content containing the “marg bar Khamenei” slogan.

As this case shows, its failure to do so led to the silencing of political speech aimed at protecting women’s rights, including through feature-limits, which can shut people out of social movements and political debate.

The Board has made recommendations to better protect political speech in critical situations, such as that in Iran, where historic, widespread, protests are being violently suppressed. This includes permitting the general use of “marg bar Khamenei” during protests in Iran.

Iranian people have been proesting for weeks against the brutal regime of the Islamic Republic. Against the systematic oppression of women and the mandatory headscarf. 
They protest and risk their own lifes. For Freedom. 
The regime's rulers block the Internet and prevent journalists from reporting. So they can break up the protest without any notice from worldwide attention.
But the protests continue. They write songs. They paint pictures. 
They bypass blocks and bans, they post videos and pictures of their protest online. 
They want the world's attention. So what can we do to make sure that people in Iran are seen? We can at least give our attention. #IranRevolution #JKLive

In the post, the user also calls the Islamic Republic the worst dictatorship in history, partly due to restrictions on what people can wear. It calls on women in Iran not to collaborate in the oppression of women.

Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday the widespread protests following the death in police custody of the young woman last month are not the actions of “ordinary Iranians” as he accused the United States and Israel of planning the demonstrations. 
The protests, now in their third week, have been met with a crackdown by police and security forces. A tally of government statements compiled by The Associated Press gave a death toll of at least 14 people with 1,500 arrests, while rights groups say at least 130 are dead with thousands arrested. 
Khamenei said the death of 22-year-old Amini was a “sad incident” and that he was heartbroken. 
Iran’s morality police arrested Amini in Tehran for allegedly not following the country’s strict dress code and she died in a hospital three days later after falling into a coma. 
The government said she died of a heart attack. Her family rejected that account, saying Amini had no history of heart problems and that she was instead beaten. They called for accountability.

For the longest time, I have stared at Panic Cycles that were due the week of November 7th. I had assumed that this Panic Cycle was a warning that the US midterm election will be a traumatic event for neither side will accept the result. However, there is something else that has come on the radar with the West's constant harassment of Russia as the media seems to be intent on insulting Russia and praying for its demise. If you keep calling someone names and saying you are a loser, what will often happen is you provoke them into one of those events where they just start throwing punches and a brawl begins. All the press constantly put out the propaganda that Putin's invasion was unprovoked. I can confirm this was all intentional and the killing of both Nord Stream pipelines last week was part of the strategy to separate Germany from Russia. It is about the collapse of debt structures and the Great Reset.

The media will also not address how the deal was Ukraine was to remain neutral, yet Zelensky pushed for NATO membership. Then on February 23rd, Zelensky the day before Putin's invasion publicly stated Ukraine would seek nuclear weapons. This is the Western Press' propaganda when in fact this has been a provoked event to overthrow Russia for the Great Reset and to impose climate change directives to shut down their energy production which was 50% of the GDP. This was also to break the energy tie of Europe to Russia.

They are pushing Russia too hard and the Russian Neocons are clamoring for Putin to get serious. I do not see a major nuclear attack, but I cannot rule out a tactical nuclear weapon. Zelensky appears to be only interested in how much money he can stash offshore and has led his country to the brink of total destruction. Running to NATO for immediate membership is inviting a nuclear attack now.

As they say - What Will Be - Will Be.  We may see European conflict erupt going into 2023, but it still appears that we will be looking at World War III with China  joining Russia post-2024.

Binance Smart Chain temporarily suspended transactions and fund transfers, after detecting what it said was an exploit on a bridge between two blockchains. Activity resumed on the blockchain early Friday, a Binance spokesman said.

Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive, said on Twitter that the issue involved BSC Token Hub, a so-called cross-chain bridge. These enable the transfer of digital assets and information from one independent blockchain to another.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe,” Mr. Zhao wrote, apologizing for the inconvenience.

Ransomware attacks are increasing in frequency, victim losses are skyrocketing, and hackers are shifting their targets. 

A spokesman for Binance said initial estimates for funds taken off the Binance Smart Chain are between $100 million and $110 million.

Binance Coin fell 3.4% from its level 24 hours prior to $284.56, according to CoinDesk data.

Cross-chain bridge hacks have become a common occurrence. In August, attackers drained $190 million worth of crypto from cross-chain bridge Nomad after a hacker exploited a vulnerability in an upgrade to the platform. So far this year, about $2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen in cross-chain bridge hacks, according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis.

(The Conversation) Images of the protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Zhina Amini on Sept. 16, 2022, in Iran and reports of the government’s brutal crackdown have circulated widely on social media. This flow of information comes despite efforts by the Iranian regime to throttle internet access and censor information leaving the country.

One effective method the protesters have hit on has been to use TikTok, the video-sharing app better known for young people posting clips of themselves singing and dancing. The way video clips are shared on the social media platform and the protesters’ clever use of labeling have helped activists circumvent the information blockade of Iran’s tech-savvy security services and reach a wide audience.

As a researcher who studies young people and participatory culture – art and information produced by nonspecialists, including fan fiction and citizen journalism – I believe that TikTok is proving to be an effective tool of political activism in the face of severe repression.

🏜 As high temperatures, droughts, and water scarcity made Iraq the world’s fifth most vulnerable country to “climate breakdown” according to the United Nations, Jusoor Post conducted an interview with Sahar Hussein Al Jassem, Deputy Chief of the Iraqi National Center of Climate Change (#NCCC) at the Ministry of Environment, on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) that was held in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh on November 6-19.

🏜 Jassem, who is a member of a 100-member delegation that attended #COP27, told Jusoor Post that Iraq has asked for $100 billion in its Nationally Determined Contribution (#NDC) report to be distributed to the development of 13 sectors. “The priority sectors include food and water security, health, climate risks, ecological systems, and energy. We will work on these five sectors in the period between 2020 and 2025,” she said.

🏜 Consequently, in a way to convince the major financial climate institutions that Iraq is strongly in need of financing in order to be able to adapt to these climate crises, the Iraqi negotiating delegation at the COP in Sharm El-Sheikh included for the first time representation from the Iraqi parliament.

🏜 “It is the first time that the delegation includes representatives from the parliamentary committee of health and environment, because we count on COP27 when it comes to financing,” she added, noting that a series of meetings took place with financial institutions like Global Environment Facility (#GEF).

She faced a lot of transportation problems as she had to go here and there to grab her art supplies and research for different projects. So her father decided to buy her a scooty to ease her everyday life. 
Shanzy going to her university on a scooter inspired more girls in her batch to get one and go around more feasibly. Now the only problem she and her fellows were facing was the unpleasant ride because of all eyes staring at them, unwanted comments passed on the streets, and sometimes even being followed and stalked by random people. 
Being harassed in a public space made them constantly worried about physical safety and feel a heightened sense of anxiety, or to be “on edge” at all times.

Just then they were introduced to Iyzil in one of their university seminars about “Women claiming public spaces without the fear of being harassed” and how Iyzil is doing its part to assure Pakistani women are empowered for their own safety.

Shanzy learned about the app’s Responders Ring feature, added all her five scooty fellows to her Iyzil responders ring. Now she has her own scooty gang and whenever any of her fellow members face any kind of street harassment or any other emergency situations, they just hit the panic alarm and whoever’s close by comes to rescue her friend. And also, Iyzil 24x7 Professional Monitoring Team contacts them to make sure that they are safe or if the situation is serious they involve emergency service on users consent.

Shanzy and her scooty gang say that they found saviors in Iyzil's Professional Monitoring Team and feel more empowered with Iyzil when on road.

Volker Turk opened an emergency session of the UN Human Rights Council, where countries were called to discuss Iran's ""deteriorating human rights situation"" and determine if a high-level international investigation is warranted.

The meeting, requested by Germany and Iceland with the backing of more than 50 countries, follows two months of protests in Iran sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, after she was arrested for an alleged breach of the country's strict dress rules for women based on Islamic sharia law.

""I call on the authorities immediately to stop using violence and harassment against peaceful protesters,"" said Turk, the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights.

""The unnecessary and disproportionate use of force must come to an end,"" he said, warning that Iran was in ""a full-fledged human rights crisis.""

""Accountability is a key ingredient of the pursuit of justice for human rights violations,"" he told the 47-member council, urging the body to vote in favour of an investigation.

Iranian authorities have grown increasingly heavy-handed in their response, as the demonstrations have spread across the country and swelled into a broad movement against the theocracy that has ruled Iran since 1979.

Turk said more than 300 people had been killed since Amini's death. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has put the toll above 400, including more than 50 children.

""The security forces... have used live ammunition, birdshot and other metal pellets, tear gas and batons,"" said Turk.

A total of 3,159 cumulative vulnerabilities have been discovered in the popular web browser, out of which 303 have been reported this year. The Atlas VPN team has not disclosed the severity but has just published the number of vulnerabilities. The figures are from the VulDB vulnerability database. The report summarises vulnerabilities reported in the database between January 1, 2022, to October 5, 2022.

Mozilla’s Firefox browser comes second with 117 vulnerabilities, and Microsoft Edge comes third with 103 vulnerabilities, which is 61% higher than the previous year. Since its release, it has had 806 vulnerabilities in total, the report states.

Apple’s Safari is the second-most widely used browser worldwide after Google Chrome and is also the safest browser with just 26 vulnerabilities reported for 2022 and 1,139 vulnerabilities overall since its debut. The report advises users to be particularly careful while choosing plug-ins as they can be malicious and has asked users to choose only reliable providers.

Recently Indian cyber agency the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) issued a high-severity advisory regarding vulnerabilities in Chrome through which hackers can gain access and execute malicious operations in the system.

Google has one of the most transparent vulnerabilities reporting processes out of all the companies, and according to experts, the same will be fixed via updates. Current users can safeguard themselves by updating their browsers to the latest version.

Network data from NetBlocks confirm a near-total disruption disruption to internet service in parts of Kurdistan province in west Iran from the evening of Monday 19 September 2022. The regional telecommunications blackout in and around Sanandaj follows a partial disruption to internet service in Tehran and other parts of the country on Friday when protests first broke out. The Instagram social media platform and WhatsApp messaging app were subsequently restricted nationally on Wednesday 21 September, followed by a nation-scale shutdown of mobile networks.

The incidents come amid widening protests against the government after the death of Mahsa Amini from Saqqez in Kurdistan province after her arrest by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating Iran’s strict hijab headscarf rules.

Observable connectivity was restored some 3.5 hours after the disruption came into place in Iran’s Kurdistan region, amid reports of at least four protesters killed by authorities. Users have also reported the disconnection or severe slowing of internet service in multiple cities since the first disruption was registered on Friday 16 September 2022. The network disruptions are likely to severely limit the public’s ability to express political discontent and communicate freely.

Our Streets Now is a campaign working to end public sexual harassment (PSH) through cultural and legislative changes. Public sexual harassment is unwanted sexual attention by strangers in public spaces including gyms, bars, parks, and the streets. PSH can be leering, unwanted comments, beeping from passing vehicles, and even following.

As a campaign, we use real-life testimonies from victims in order to illustrate the impact and reality of PSH. If you would like to share your experience (s) of PSH, you can submit yours via our website.

The number of people who have died in the protests that have rocked Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini has risen to 31, AFP reported on Thursday, 22 September.

Additionally, the Iranian government also blocked access to WhatsApp and Instagram.

Instagram and WhatsApp are two of the most widely used apps in Iran after the blocking of other social media platforms in recent years like Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, and Tiktok.

Iran has been swept by nearly a week of protests since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being arrested by morality police that enforce the clerics' rules on how women dress.

A total of 3,159 cumulative vulnerabilities have been discovered in the popular web browser, out of which 303 have been reported this year. The Atlas VPN team has not disclosed the severity but has just published the number of vulnerabilities. The figures are from the VulDB vulnerability database. The report summarises vulnerabilities reported in the database between January 1, 2022, to October 5, 2022.

Mozilla’s Firefox browser comes second with 117 vulnerabilities, and Microsoft Edge comes third with 103 vulnerabilities, which is 61% higher than the previous year. Since its release, it has had 806 vulnerabilities in total, the report states.

Apple’s Safari is the second-most widely used browser worldwide after Google Chrome and is also the safest browser with just 26 vulnerabilities reported for 2022 and 1,139 vulnerabilities overall since its debut. The report advises users to be particularly careful while choosing plug-ins as they can be malicious and has asked users to choose only reliable providers.

Recently Indian cyber agency the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) issued a high-severity advisory regarding vulnerabilities in Chrome through which hackers can gain access and execute malicious operations in the system.

Google has one of the most transparent vulnerabilities reporting processes out of all the companies, and according to experts, the same will be fixed via updates. Current users can safeguard themselves by updating their browsers to the latest version.

Dozens of people have been killed by security forces during the nationwide demonstrations, according to rights groups, and the government has sought to blame foreign powers for the uprising.

“They want to put anyone who can become a voice of the protesters or play a role in how these protests develop behind bars right now,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of CHRI. “The protests are leaderless and grass-roots. The impact will be determined when there’s a collective voice. And these are the kind of people that can be that collective voice.”

Journalists also have been rounded up in the crackdown, with at least 29 detained since Amini’s death in mid-September, according to CHRI.

iranians are asking for those outside of iran to their voice. share their stories. don’t let their deaths be in vain. scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

the islamic republic of iran regime  is blocking the internet. iranians have to use vpn & other dangerous methods to get content out. when we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of iranians. they want us to help get their stories out. 

doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. footage being widespread online also raises morale of iranians to keep protesting. 

2. use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out 

use these tags when you post:

The unrest, now going on three months, was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran for violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. Protesters have faced a brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces using live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas. At least 451 people have been killed, including 63 minors, according to HRANA. Another 18,173 have been detained, the rights monitor reports.

Moradkhani is a longtime activist whose late father (married to Khamenei’s sister) was an opposition figure. The branch of the family has opposed Khamenei for decades and Moradkhani has previously been imprisoned for her activism.

An Iranian protest anthem that has become the soundtrack to the national uprising was again thrust into the international spotlight over the weekend when @coldplay performed a cover and broadcast it live around the world.

The British band played the song, Baraye, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday and Saturday night at the start of their world tour, with the exiled Iranian actor @golfarahani on stage and singing in Farsi.

Baraye, which means “For …” or “Because of …”, was written by one of Iran’s most popular musicians, @shervinine, with verses taken from online posts by Iranians explaining why they have been demonstrating against the country's regime. Days after the song was released, the 25-year-old was arrested and his song deleted from Instagram.

Iran has been gripped by protests since the death in custody on 16 September of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old of Kurdish origin who was arrested in Tehran by the “morality police” over her headscarf. Amini was allegedly beaten, taken to hospital in a coma and later died.

Since then, protests led by women have been met with violence by authorities, with at least 270 people dead and 14,000 arrested, according to the group Human Rights Activists in Iran.

Friday’s concert was streamed via satellite to cinemas in 81 countries, although not in Iran, where playing or singing the song could lead to arrest.

The actress, who in 2000 won the Miss World beauty pageant often speaks up for girl empowerment, girl child rights, gender issues, and the importance of education on global platforms. 

Priyanka Chopra recently interviewed US Vice President Kamala Harris after representing India at the UN General Assembly (UNGA). From abortion laws to equal pay, the actress discussed some of the most important issues with Harris during their interaction. 

Amid the ongoing Iran protests, Priyanka Chopra aka PeeCee has lent her support to the courageous women of Iran and has also encouraged people to add their voices to this movement that erupted after following the death of a young woman named Mahsa Amini. 

On Friday, Priyanka triggered a controversy with her remarks on the ongoing Iran protests. While many in India lauded the actress for taking a stand, others questioned the actress for ignoring similar issues rampant in India. 

Taking to Twitter, a user wrote, ""Priyanka Chopra’s concern for Iranian women is hugely appreciated, but her silence on Bilkis Bano and the state-enabled persecution of Muslims, especially marginalised women in her home country, India is worth introspection ?"" 

Another said, ""Celebrities can’t gain woke points by speaking about issues outside of their country, while simultaneously ignoring similar issues that are rampant in India.""

A #Michigan woman is accused of targeting two teens in a year-long #catfishing scheme where she harassed them on social media.

Kendra Licari, 42, was charged earlier this week with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit the crime and another count of obstruction of justice. 

According to FBI investigators, Licari targeted her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend since last December and attempted to cover up her act by filing a complaint with the Beal City Schools‘ administration. 

Around that time, Licari worked as a girls‘ basketball coach at the school and at the end of the season, she was asked not to return due to coaching changes.

School district officials said the cyber bullying occurred off of school grounds and the school’s devices were not used. 

They decided to involve local authorities to look into the case as the harassment started in early 2021. 

Isabella County prosecutor David Barberi said the investigation was intense since Licari allegedly used slang to make it seem like the catfish was the same age as her daughter.

After authorities were stuck with no other options, they turned to FBI’s computer crime deviation in April and discovered a few months later that they believed Licari was involved in the cyberbullying. 

Superintendent William Chilman said in a statement that the FBI officials were able to track down the IP addresses used to send the messages to her daughter.

After Licari was confronted about the cyber harassment, she broke down and made a full confession. 

She was released often her arraignment and faces multiple charges which included using a computer to commit the crime, stalking a minor, and obstruction of justice. Each count is a five-year felony.

#MahsaAmini #مهسا_امینی 

Since 16 September 2022, Iranian people have taken to the streets to protest against the Islamic Republic following the brutal murder of Mahsa Jina Amini, a young Kurdish woman, at the hands of government forces. 

The Islamic Republic has been a major source of oppression against women, religious and ethnic minorities, and Iranian society as a whole. Freedom is non-existent, the economy is deteriorating, the environment is degraded. Protests spanning across 146 cities have rapidly turned into Iran’s first ever feminist-led revolutionary movement. Its motto is “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” in Kurdish, “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” in Farsi, or “Woman, Life, Freedom” in English. 

Over 18,000 people have been arrested since the start of this revolution. Amongst them are people of all genders, ages, beliefs, and sexual orientations: children, striking workers, artists, lawyers, actresses, athletes, nurses and doctors, students and teachers, families of those arrested or killed. All those actively opposing the current regime know they are at risk of incarceration.

In addition, the Islamic Republic’s parliament has formally called upon the judiciary to impose death penalties against all jailed protesters. Though few have been sentenced to death so far, this move provides the grounds for others to suffer the same faith. Even one death sentence is one too many. This is one of the many strategies used by the government to deter opposition and protest. Other strategies include violence, torture, rape, as well as intimidation, harassment, and threats against activists and their families.",,,,"6,362",4.65,"“bricks of a revolution”

#SoheilaGolestani
Iranian actress-director Soheila Golestani was abducted from her home by #Iran’s security forces in #Tehran last week and taken to an unknown location after she published and appeared in a viral video staging a silent #protest with her colleagues without the #hijab. The video was a symbolic act of defiance in support of women’s rights and the revolutionary uprising which has swept Iran since the death of #MahsaAmini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who was murdered while in custody of the morality police in Tehran.⁠
⁠
“Our true heroes are the nameless people. We do not cross out our mistakes. We practice and learn again. The ways are countless and the hope for a new day is strong,” Soheila wrote on her Instagram just before she was abducted. Her colleague, theatre Director Hamid Pourazari who appears in the video was also detained and taken to an unknown location by security forces. ⁠
⁠
There are growing concerns over the health of Soheila who suffers from a rare brain tumor and epilepsy and is at risk of seizures without medication and medical care. The Islamic Republic continues to deny vulnerable prisoners access to lifesaving healthcare and limits contact with their families. ⁠
⁠
The campaign of mass arrests in recent months which includes a growing number of women artists, journalists, activists and children is an attempt to silence voices and opposition. Those who are detained risk long prison sentence, torture and the death penalty. ⁠

Alidoosti had condemned the hanging of Mohsen Shekari, who was killed in December in the first known execution linked to the protests, according to CNN.

Taraneh Alidoosti was arrested as there was a “lack of evidence for her claims,” CNN reported citing Fars news agency. In November, Alidoosti shared a picture of herself on Instagram without the Islamic hijab and holding a sign reading “Women, Life, Freedom” to offer support for the protest movement.

After Shekari’s execution, Taraneh Alidoosti in another post said, “Your silence means supporting tyranny and tyrants,” adding that “every international organization who is watching this bloodshed and not taking action, is a disgrace to humanity,” according to CNN. Since then, her account on Instagram has been deleted. She has featured in the 2016 Oscar-winning movie, “The Salesman” and has starred in various popular Iranian TV shows.

In its report on Alidoosti, Fars news agency said, “Some celebrities make claims without evidence and publish provocations and have been thus arrested,” according to CNN. The local rights group, Committee to Counter Violence Against Women in Iranian Cinema, in a post on Twitter said that it wasn’t clear which government department had taken Alidoosti into custody.

Earlier in November, Taraneh Alidoosti denied reports that claimed that she had left Iran. Alidoosti announced that she planned to live in Iran and affirmed her support for the families of prisoners.

According to CNN, Taraneh Alidoosti wrote, “I will stand by the families of prisoners and the killed and will demand justice for them. I will fight for my home and I will pay any cost to stand for my rights.”

As per the news report, several Iranians have been sentenced to death by execution during the nationwide protests which erupted after the death of 22-year-old woman Mahsa Amini.

In Iran, a woman’s voice is considered half of a man for in court for every one male witness you need two women. Because only 2 womens voices can be equal to 1 mans.. can you imagine?

And this is just one of the many rights we are fighting for

The right to have custody of our children (even an abusive husband gets full custody)
The right to travel without a man’s permission
The right to be in positions of power
The right to equal land
The right to sing
The right to dance

The right to exist as a female

Without being seen as a threat or distraction that must be covered by weak men

Right now young women are the biggest threat to this regime
They are targeting us because they fear our wisdom, our courage, our ferocity for truth

The data dump was identified by Chad Loder, the founder of cyber security awareness company Habitu8, who shared the news in a post to his Twitter account on November 23 - and his account was suspended shortly after posting.

Loder announced the attack impacted users in the European Union and the United States and the data exposed is enough to unleash phishing attacks to obtain login credentials. 

Removing Loder's tweets and suspension has sparked concerns that Twitter is trying to hide the issue, with some Twitter users saying Musk 'banned [Loder] for exposing how weak Twitter security is.'

Dear [Media Exec],

I am writing to express my concern over the lack of coverage of the ongoing protests in Iran and the reported executions of protestors. As leaders in the media industry, it is your responsibility to inform the public about important events happening around the world, and the situation in Iran deserves urgent attention.

As you are likely aware, the people of Iran have been protesting in large numbers against the government and its policies, with some reports suggesting that the protests may be the largest the country has seen in decades. These protests are a crucial moment in Iran's history and deserve the attention of the international community, including the news media.

Furthermore, there have been disturbing reports of the Iranian government cracking down on the protests with violence, including the use of live ammunition and the execution of protestors. It is essential that these reports be investigated and covered in the media in order to hold the Iranian government accountable for its actions and to provide a voice for the protestors.

I urge your news organizations to prioritize covering the Iran protests and the reported executions of protestors. The people of Iran deserve to have their stories heard and their struggles highlighted in the face of such grave injustices.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]

While university students have played a pivotal role in the protests with dozens of universities on strike, unconfirmed reports on social media showed workers at Abadan and Kangan oil refineries and the Bushehr petrochemical plant have joined in.

A video on Twitter showed dozens of workers blocking the road to the Bushehr site in Assaluyeh on Iran's Gulf coast, and chanting ""death to the dictator"".

Iran's Oil Ministry was not immediately available to comment.

Protests have swept the country since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iran's Kurdish region, died on September 16 while being held for ""inappropriate attire"", marking one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.

That revolution, in which the clergy swept to power, was helped by a combination of mass demonstrations and strikes by oil workers and Bazaar merchants.

However, analysts say the Iranian regime will likely contain unrest for now, and prospects of an imminent dawn of a new political order are slim.

Bolt was recently told there was only about $12,000 remaining in the account, his lawyer Linton P. Gordon said in a phone interview, according to Bloomberg.

The account was said to be part of Bolt’s retirement and lifetime savings.

“It’s distressful news for anyone. And certainly in the case of Mr. Bolt, who established this account as part of his private pension,” Gordon said on Wednesday.

Jamaica’s Financial Services Commission on Tuesday said it had installed its own temporary manager at SSL, following reports of allegations of fraud that had earlier prompted the commission to put the bank under enhanced oversight.

Gordon said regulators have not communicated with him or his client, adding that if Bolt does not see the money returned within eight days, he plans to take the case to the Supreme Court in Kingston.

Bolt, an eight-time Olympic gold medal winner, is considered the world’s fastest man, holding world records in the 100-meter and 200-meter races.

As per reports, Nasr-Azadani was campaigning for women's rights and basic freedom in Iran and was handed a death sentence.

It may be mentioned this move has been condemned by many and FIFPro, the worldwide representative organisation for 65,000 professional footballers, has criticised the Iranian government.

""FIFPRO is shocked and sickened by reports that professional footballer Amir Nasr-Azadani faces execution in Iran after campaigning for women's rights and basic freedom in his country.

@ahmedeldin - Keep amplifying the voices of the people in Iran. Particularly women, who are leading this revolt. 

Protests are now being reported in every province in ⁦‪the country‬⁩. The government admits to killing 35 but Amnesty says they shot 19 people dead — including 3 children — on Wednesday night alone. 

This is the culmination of 43 years of oppression. It is starting to seem as though the government has two choices — reform, or revolution. 

Iran's main reformist party called Saturday for an end to the mandatory Islamic dress code for women in force since 1983, after eight straight nights of protests. #mahsaamini #iran

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented. 

4. Organize to support iranians where you live 
Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country. DISCLAIMER: Due to sanctions against Iran, it is illegal to fundraise to send money there legally. Be wary of funds collection",,,,"2,941",3.95,"repost @the.wellness.therapist

to the international community, our sisters & brothers in iran have lost access to the internet. they are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. the regime of the islamic republic of iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. they are being killed in the dark. i humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

iranians are asking for those outside of iran to their voice. share their stories. don’t let their deaths be in vain. scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

the islamic republic of iran is blocking the internet. iranians have to use vpn & other dangerous methods to get content out. when we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of iranians. they want us to help get their stories out. 

doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. footage being widespread online also raises morale of iranians to keep protesting. 

2. use specific & creative hashtags to get word out 

use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #mahsa_amini #iran #iranprotests

Binance said late Thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB tokens off the network. So-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.

The company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on BSC, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.

Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

“An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC,” Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, said in a tweet Thursday evening.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”

BNB Chain has since resumed operations.

In total, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, Binance’s BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.

The hack was caused by a bug in the bridge’s smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm Immunefi. Smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.

Actress Jessica Chastain insists it is “really important” for her to raise awareness about the ongoing protests in Iran and she has hailed the “women-led revolution” taking place in the country.

The ‘Good Nurse’ actress used her Twitter account in September to shine a spotlight on the tragic death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was murdered by the country’s morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly, and she is closely following the ongoing reaction to the shocking incident, which has sparked waves of women cutting their hair or shedding their head coverings in protest, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

She told ‘Entertainment Tonight’: “It’s really important for me to use my platform to amplify anyone’s struggle for freedom and peace and safety. And what’s happening in Iran right now is heartbreaking to me. I’m following the news every day as I hope everyone is, and my heart’s with those girls.”

Chastain praised the “strength” of the women in speaking out and hailed their actions as “incredible”.

She added: “This is a women-led revolution. And I have such belief in them, and I send them so much strength and love and support. And I think it’s incredible what they’re doing.”

Chastain’s new movie, ‘The Good Nurse’, sees her play Amy Loughren, a nurse who was forced to turn detective when she discovered one of her colleagues was responsible for the murder of dozens of patients across nine hospitals over 16 years.

And the 45-year-old star was keen to make the real-life story because she is keen to “amplify the stories of women”.

She said: “It’s part of the reason I wanted to make the film. I love using my platform to amplify the stories of women, because I find that (in) this country, for some reason, they haven’t been acknowledged up until now. And so, I want to celebrate women’s heroism and their incredible stories, and Amy’s story is mind-blowing and compassionate.”

“She’s a hero.”

Nika Shakarami was one of thousands of Iranian women who took to the streets to protest the horrific killing of Mahsa Jina Amini.

She joined the protests in Tehran
on September 20. And then she disappeared.

She had gone with friends, who said she had been fearlessly chanting in Mahsa's name.
But as night fell, the protests grew more intense, and Nika was separated from her friends.

In her last known communication, she told them that she was being chased by security forces.

Then her phone was turned off and her Telegram and Instagram accounts were deleted.

Frantic, her family searched everywhere for her.

She was missing for 10 days.

Then they found her dead body at a morgue in a local detention center.

Her nose had been completely smashed in, her skull broken from multiple blows.

The family were told that Nika had been held by the IRGC and briefly detained in Tehran's
notorious Evin Prison - the IRGC tried to claim that she died after ""falling from a great height.""

Her family was then pressured by the authorities to not hold a funeral ceremony and bury her in
silence.

Despite being forced into agreeing, the authorities then stole her body and buried her 40km away in order to avoid publicity and suppress further protest.

She was buried on what would've been her 17th birthday.

On top of all that, there are reports stating that Nika was repeatedly raped and suffered sexual torture, and that a large cut down the middle of her torso indicated that her organs had been removed.

These are some of the people living in North America who have a long track record of lobbying in support of Khamenei’s regime occupying Iran. They’re mainly active on Twitter, in addition to making media appearances and publishing articles to echo the talking points of the regime in English to a Western audience. They do this by presenting themselves as “progressives” who just want peace and stability. Their main tactic is to use nice sounding terms such as “anti-war” and “diplomacy” to make it seem like they are not on the side of the regime. But their main goal is to keep this ISIS-style dictatorship in power no matter what. They have been lying to their Western audience for years, claiming that people in Iran do not want the regime gone, they just want “reforms”. This, of course, is absolute nonsense. They falsely accuse political prisoners, family members of innocent people killed by the regime, and other Iranian activists, of being “warmongers”. They whitewash the crimes of the regime and have always tried to hijack mass protests in Iran to misrepresent them.

With the recent huge anti-regime protests taking place in Iran and the clear message of the Iranian people, which is that they do not want the Islamic Republic in power, their constant rambling has not stopped one bit. Their tactics slightly change from time to time to fit the situation and not be too evident, but their goal is always the same. Some of them are desperately trying to save face now, even going back to delete their previous articles, tweets, and videos. Of course, it’s too late and completely pointless since people have downloaded, taken screenshots, and saved it all!

Stay alert, know their names, and do not fall for their tricks! Iran will be free one day, and when that day comes, I assure you that Iranian people will not forget or forgive those who for years lobbied for that barbaric oppressive regime while living comfortably in North America!

This just came out in The Economist @theeconomist. Can't find an author's name anywhere, nor editorial board endorsement, but it's out there.

Not sure what this reporter is on, or what revolution they're watching, but it's apparent that things are moving inside of Iran, and the regime is on its' heels. Not sure why The Economist has decided to post what is in my opinion propaganda for the regime, and does not accurately reflect things that are going on inside of Iran.

This is the crap that goes out and smothers all of our efforts to get a worldwide coalition of citizens to back the Iranian revolutionaries, and makes people who don't know any better to say, ""Oh, it's over."", or ""Oh, nothing to do here.""

Nonsense. This is the time to topple the weakened regime over.

not sure what this reporter is on, or what revolution they're watching, but it's apparent that things are moving inside of iran, and the regime is on its' heels. not sure why the economist has decided to post what is in my opinion propaganda for the regime, and does not accurately reflect things that are going on inside of iran.

this is the crap that goes out and smothers all of our efforts to get a worldwide coalition of citizens to back the iranian revolutionaries, and makes people who don't know any better to say, ""oh, it's over."", or ""oh, nothing to do here.""

nonsense. this is the time to topple the weakened regime over.

⁠
Rekabi was met by hordes of reporters and admirers at the Imam Khomeini international airport, many of whom applauded, chanted her name and called her a hero.⁠
⁠
All female athletes from the Islamic Republic are required to wear a hijab during competitive sports and international appearances. On Sunday, Rekabi competed in Seoul wearing just a black headband with her dark hair tied in a ponytail. Iran’s flag was emblazoned across her shirt.⁠
⁠
Supporters of Rekabi believe she actively chose not to wear the headscarf in response to intense protests in Iran following the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained by Iran’s morality police. Amini was accused of breaking a morality law that requires women to wear a headscarf, cover their arms and legs and wear loose clothing.⁠
⁠
The demonstrations, drawing school-age children, oil workers and others to the streets in over 100 cities across the nation, represent the most serious challenge to Iran’s theocracy since the mass protests surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Many Iranian women have since removed their government mandated hijabs in public.⁠
⁠
At the airport, Rekabi maintained to reporters that not wearing a hijab in Seoul was “unintentional.” A statement allegedly from Rekabi was posted to social media this week where she claimed she “forgot” to wear her hijab after leaving a women’s-only waiting area prior to her competition.⁠
⁠
Rekabi appeared at the Imam Khomeini International Airport wearing a ballcap and hoodie to cover her hair.⁠
⁠
The Iranian government routinely pressures activists at home and abroad, often airing what rights group describe as coerced confessions on state television — the same cameras she addressed on her arrival back home.⁠

Lapsus$ hacking group has been creating a ruckus with the group targeting Tech giants like Microsoft, Samsung, and NVIDIA. In March this year, London City Police had arrested 7 teenagers in connection with these hacking incidents. One of the seven was a 16-year-old boy from Oxford, who was arrested because other hackers leaked his name and address online. The lad uses ""White"" and ""Breachbase"" as his online aliases.

It is reported that the teenager made around $14 million from his cybercrimes. After a lull of a few months, GTA6 leaks went viral, and over 90 videos of RockStar Games' most awaited video game got leaked on GTAForums, around the same time global ride-hailing giant Uber suffered a data breach as well.

Hackers have posted on Doxbin, that its 'Arion', the same teenager from Oxford, who goes by the online alias of 'White' or 'Breachbase', was behind the GTA6 and Uber data breaches.

Interestingly, The 'teapotuberhacker' gave 'Uber Hack' as a 'Past work' reference on the GTAForums while leaking the GTA6 videos. This could mean only one thing, that is Mr. 'teapotuberhacker', 'Breachbase', and 'White' is the same person, the teenage hacker from Oxford.

Yet stories are not to ignore the reality around us, are they? As they are coming out of true experiences, they can make changes for real, they can prevent some tragedies from happening again and again.

Jina, officially named Mahsa Amini was a 22 years-old Kurdish woman visiting Tehran where she was arrested by Morality police for not complying with a compulsory hijab and later died in hospital due to potential police brutality. Her death lit such a fire in hearts that brought numerous people into the streets all over the country (Iran) to protest. Not only to demand justice for her death but for their stolen freedom and the respect every human being deserves.Their bravery is beyond my words!
_ 

Since yesterday, Iran has shut down the internet and blocked social media platforms to silence their voices. At this point, a possible massacre may happen as it happened in 2019. In such a critical condition, Anonymous hackers are supporting people against oppression while Meta is supporting oppression by removing related posts from Instagram (non-violent content), and by blocking Iranians What’s app accounts! Your voice matters cause you can be their voice!
_ 

Her official name Mahsa means ""moon alike"". Her given name Jina is a Kurdish name which I think has the same origin as the word gene, meaning reproductive, alive, and life-giver. Let's be her name, and let's multiply her by disseminate her story as a symbol who freed a land from demons of darkness. As her mother said, also her epitaph: ""Jina, my dear, you won't die! Your name will become a symbol."" 

This painting has been shared as an expression of sorrow, but not anymore. Please share this post and ask people to read the caption and share it using the hashtag #MahsaAmini if they like! It was her birthday yesterday and this is my gift to her!

•
Shortly after, he was summoned by the Iranian judiciary for questioning, according to social media posts by local media and community members. 
•
His friends have not heard from him since. They fear he has been arrested. 
•
Khezrnejad's disappearance comes at a time of great civil unrest in Iran. Protests and calls for the removal of the current Iranian government have been ongoing throughout the country since a young woman named Mahsa Amini died in police custody in September.
•
Those demonstrations have been met with increasingly brutal responses from the government-controlled Iranian security forces.
•
""I had never seen Ayub speaking this way. The feeling in his voice … stressed, frustrated, shocked,” his friend said about Khezrnejad’s 45-second video. 
•
CBC News is not naming the friend due to the potential danger to his family in Iran.
•
Khezrnejad completed his master's program in the fall of 2015 at Memorial University in St. John's. He returned home to Iran in early 2017.
•
When they last spoke in 2019, Khezrnejad was doing well, his friend said. 
•
His friend said nobody has heard an update from Khezrnejad since he showed up to the judiciary summons. It’s unclear when that was. Some of the earliest posts reporting that Ayub had been detained were on Nov. 24.
•
His friend hopes this will be one more example of why people outside of Iran need to speak up for those still living in his home country.

Zelensky tweeted out a poll of his own, asking Twitter users which Musk they like better: “One who supports Ukraine” or “One who supports Russia.” 

Musk’s Twitter poll drew widespread attention on Monday afternoon when the SpaceX and Tesla CEO asked users if they supported his peace proposal for the war in Ukraine.

Musk’s proposal was to redo elections in regions of Ukraine annexed by Russia, with the elections under United Nations supervision, have Ukraine cede the Crimean peninsula to Russia, and for Ukraine to remain as a neutral country between Russia and the West.

The poll earned a response from Ukrainian diplomat Andriy Melnyk, who told the billionaire to “f— off” shortly after the tweet was posted.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded by asking his audience if they prefer Musk to be pro-Ukraine or ro-Russia. WWW.UPWARD.NEWS",,,"2,098",-3.25,"ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky responded to elon musk’s poll about whether ukraine should give up territory to russia on monday by turning the tables on the tech billionaire.

zelensky tweeted out a poll of his own, asking twitter users which musk they like better: “one who supports ukraine” or “one who supports russia.” 

musk’s twitter poll drew widespread attention on monday afternoon when the spacex and tesla ceo asked users if they supported his peace proposal for the war in ukraine.

musk’s proposal was to redo elections in regions of ukraine annexed by russia, with the elections under united nations supervision, have ukraine cede the crimean peninsula to russia, and for ukraine to remain as a neutral country between russia and the west.

the poll earned a response from ukrainian diplomat andriy melnyk, who told the billionaire to “f— off” shortly after the tweet was posted.

Kendra Licari,42, was charged earlier this week with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit the crime and another count of obstruction of justice. According to FBI investigators, Licari targeted her daughter and her daughter’s boyfriend since last December and attempted to cover up her act by filing a complaint with the Beal City Schools‘ administration. Around that time, Licari worked as a girls‘ basketball coach at the school and at the end of the season, she was asked not to return due to coaching changes.

School district officials said the cyber bullying occurred off of school grounds and the school’s devices were not used. They decided to involve local authorities to look into the case as the harassment started in early 2021. Isabella County prosecutor David Barberi said the investigation was intense since Licari allegedly used slang to make it seem like the catfish was the same age as her daughter.

After authorities were stuck with no other options, they turned to FBI’s computer crime deviation in April and discovered a few months later that they believed Licari was involved in the cyberbullying. Superintendent William Chilman said in a statement that the FBI officials were able to track down the IP addresses used to send the messages to her daughter.

After Licari was confronted about the cyber harassment, she broke down and made a full confession. She was released often her arraignment and She faces multiple charges which included using a computer to commit the crime, stalking a minor, and obstruction of justice. Each count is a five-year felony.

However, it is unclear why Licari committed the crime and she is expected to appear in court on December 29⛓️👀🤦🏽‍♂️📲 Thoughts",TEEN DISCOVERS ANONYMOUS CYBERBULLY WHO HARASSED HER FOR A YEAR WAS HER OWN MOTHER TVO APHOUSE RHT @raphousetv,,,"1,971",-1.02,"a michigan woman is accused of targeting two teens in a year-long catfishing scheme where she harassed them on social media.

“While she was scaling that wall in Seoul without the state’s forced hijab, Ms. Rekabi was showing the world who she is: A professional climber and Iranian woman with a spine of steel,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“She, like countless women in Iran, has risked everything to tell the world that she opposes the state’s policy of forced hijab, and we are extremely worried about her safety,” he added.

“Ms. Rekabi risked her freedom and safety and has since been under extreme pressure by the government to cover up her courageous act of civil disobedience,” said Ghaemi. “It is now the responsibility of all people who support women’s and human rights to stand with her and not let the government in Iran cover up the true story.”

CHRI stands by Iranian athletes who are calling for the government in Iran to be held accountable for its repressive policies, and calls on the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFCS) to suspend Iran’s membership.

CHRI also urges the IFCS, climbing professionals and the international community to not accept the Iranian government’s attempts to flip this story.

These groups and individuals should make statements in support of Rekabi, who has not been allowed to speak freely since she competed, and all women in Iran who are risking their lives to speak out against repressive state policies.

Those journalists include Niloofar Hamed, who was the first person to report Mahsa Amini's story. 

She has now been in solitary confinement for almost a month, according to her lawyer.

Ms Hamedi shared a photo of Ms Amini's parents hugging each other in a Tehran hospital, where their daughter was lying in a coma. 

The photo, posted on Twitter on September 16, was the first sign to the world that all was not well with 22-year-old Ms Amini, who had been detained three days earlier by Iran's morality police for what they deemed inappropriate dress.

Ms Amini's death later that day would unleash a wave of mass protests across Iran that were still persisting nearly three weeks later in different parts of the country, despite a government crackdown.

The photo of Ms Amini's parents was also one of the last things Ms Hamedi, who worked for the pro-reform Sharq Daily, would post before she was arrested some days later and her Twitter account listed as suspended.

""This morning, intelligence agents raided my client Niloofar Hamedi's house, arrested her, searched her house, and confiscated her belongings,"" Ms Hamedi's lawyer Mohammad Ali Kamfirouzi tweeted on September 22.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called on Iranian authorities to ""immediately and unconditionally release … all journalists arrested because of their coverage of Mahsa Amini's death and the protests that have followed"".

It said last month that at least 28 journalists had been detained by the security forces, including Ms Hamedi.

Friends of Ms Hamedi described her as a brave journalist, passionate about women's issues and rights.

""She always went beyond her limit to be the voice of voiceless women who were deprived from their rights, whether by their fathers, husbands or by social limitations,"" one friend told Reuters.

""Canada strongly condemns the reprehensible detention and killing of Mahsa Amini,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly. 
 
""Her death was a direct result of the systemic and continued harassment and repression of women by Iran. We further condemn the violent crackdowns on civilians, which have caused additional deaths and injuries, in blatant violation of their human rights. We salute the courage of the Iranian women who are peacefully protesting and we join them in sending the regime a very clear message: they must end all forms of persecution and violence against women.""

In recent days I have been in contact with many people from UCW’s Iranian community. UCW is home to hundreds of international students from Iran, as well as Iranian faculty and staff. This is a time of deep anxiety for them amid concern for the safety of family and friends. On behalf of UCW, I express our community’s solidarity with them.
 
I remind all our students, faculty and staff that here in Canada, whether as citizens, landed immigrants or international students with a visa, your rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech and freedom from discrimination are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. No advance permit is required to organize or gather in support of a cause.
 
I encourage students, faculty and staff who are affected by or concerned about these events to reach out to support services available both on campus and on-line. UCW is a truly international community with students from around the world here on our campuses. Let's pull together to support those who are struggling.

More than $600 million in crypto left bankrupt crypto company FTX’s wallets late Friday, with little clear explanation as to why.
Soon afterwards, FTX stated in its official Telegram channel that it had been hacked, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps.
“FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don't go on FTX site as it might download Trojans,” wrote an account administrator in the FTX Support Telegram chat. The message was pinned by FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller.
According to on-chain data, various Ethereum tokens, as well as Solana and Binance Smart Chain tokens have exited FTX’s official wallets and moved to decentralised exchanges like 1inch. Both FTX and FTX US appear to be affected.

On Jan. 8, 2020, Esmaeilion’s wife, Parisa, and only child, 9-year-old Reera, were killed when the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 shortly after it took off from Tehran’s international airport. The mother and daughter were returning to Canada after visiting family in Iran over the winter holidays. Esmaeilion, a dentist and writer whose novels critical of the Islamic republic were growing increasingly popular inside and outside Iran, had stayed behind in Toronto, knowing that if he traveled with his family, he would probably run into trouble with Iranian authorities.

After the horrific crash, Esmaeilion returned to Iran to take possession of his family’s remains for burial in Canada, overcoming threats and obstacles from Iranian authorities. In the months after his return to Toronto, Esmaeilion and relatives of others who died in the plane crash formed the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims, for which he continues to serve as spokesman.
Their simple goals were justice for the dead and accountability for the perpetrators. But their efforts ran into bureaucratic roadblocks, a pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and apathy from a world desensitized by an endless diet of bad news.

That is, until this past September, when protests erupted in Tehran after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Among the many members of the Iranian diaspora who amplified the demands of protesters inside Iran were members of the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims.

Now Esmaeilion has become a leading voice outside Iran in the anti-regime movement — an essential bridge between Iranians in diaspora who want to promote a freer future for their homeland and the millions inside Iran who live under an abusive system that has long operated with impunity.

""raise your daughters to shout, to scream, to hold their heads up high for being themselves before society tries to teach them how to silence themselves, how to wear shame like it's a second skin. let them taste rebellion from the moment they are born and watch them become flames to start a revolution.""

Trudeau tweeted on Monday evening that Canada “denounces the Iranian regime’s barbaric decision to impose the death penalty on nearly 15,000 protestors. These brave Iranians were fighting for their human rights — and we continue to stand united in support of them, and united against the regime’s heinous actions.”

Within that tweet, however, there is a false premise that Iran is planning to execute “nearly 15,000 protesters” arrested in the wake of street protests and violent rallies sparked in mid-September by yet another piece of fake news – the alleged police killing of 22-year-old woman Mahsa Amini.

Trudeau’s post, despite being immediately dismissed as false by several Twitter users, remained up for more than 11 hours and was shared thousands of times before it was deleted.

While the Canadian prime minister may have been the most important politician who shared the fake story, there were countless others who piled on – whether intentionally or unintentionally – and condemned the Islamic Republic thanks to the incredible lie.

The fake report especially went viral on Twitter and Instagram, where an infographic claimed that “Iran Sentences 15,000 protesters to death — as a ‘hard lesson’ for all rebels.” Many celebrities also fell for the lie and shared it with their followers.

The emissions monitoring company @ghgsat attributed the plume to the oil and gas sector and estimated methane was spewing at a rate of 795 kilograms an hour at the time of the observation. 

The emissions occurred near the Arsanjan-Kheirgoo Gas Compressor Station. The site’s three compressors help ship as much as 110 million cubic meters of gas a day from the South Pars field 1,050 kilometers (650 miles) north to Tehran and were designed to increase transmission capacity during the winter heating season, according to a promotional video from the site's operating subsidiary Sekafco.

National Iranian Oil spews more methane than any other global energy producer according to a report last week by the San Francisco-based Global Energy Monitor. The non-profit group found that just 30 fossil fuel companies account for nearly half of the sector’s emissions of the potent greenhouse gas. (See the list in the article at the link in our bio.)

Methane is the primary component of natural gas and responsible for about 30% of the Earth’s warming. Releases and leaks can occur during extraction and transport of the fossil fuel.

Scientists say reducing the emissions of methane, which has 84 times the warming power of carbon dioxide during its first two decades in the atmosphere, is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to cool the planet.

All throughout the #COP27 climate talks, Bloomberg Green will exclusively publish new satellite images of methane releases captured around the world, in collaboration with GHGSat.

The report by Atlas VPN has stated that these figures are based on data from the VulDB vulnerability database, covering January 1, 2022 to October 5, 2022.

As per the report, Google Chrome is the only browser with new vulnerabilities in the five days in October. Recent ones are CVE-202203318, CVE-2022-3314, CVE-2022-3311, CVE-2022-3309 and CVE-2022-3307.

The CVE programme tracks security flaws and vulnerabilities across multiple platforms. The database does not list details for these flaws, but the report said they can lead to memory corruption on a computer.

Users can fix these by updating to Google Chrome version 106.0.5249.61. Reportedly, Mozilla’s Firefox browser is in second place for vulnerabilities with 117 of them.

Microsoft Edge was reported to have 103 vulnerabilities as of October 5, with 61% more than the entire year of 2021. Overall, it had 806 vulnerabilities since its release.

Talking about Safari, it has some of the lowest levels of vulnerabilities in comparison with others. In the first three quarters of 2022, it witnessed 26 vulnerabilities and its number of cumulative vulnerabilities were 1,139 since its release, the report said.

Notably, the Opera browser had no documented vulnerabilities so far in 2022 and only 344 total vulnerabilities.

As of May 2022, Safari has witnessed over a billion users and Apple has been working hard to make sure its browser is secure and safe to use.

The Russian Vedomosti news agency has revealed in an article that Russia and Iran are gearing up to launch a new gold-backed stablecoin.

This new stablecoin would be used for cross-border transactions instead of USD and other fiat currencies, and it would first  operate in a special economic zone in Astrakhan, where Russia is accepting cargo shipments from Iran. Iran is exploring new alternative methods of conducting foreign trade in the context of ongoing international trade sanctions against the country. 

According to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain, the token is anticipated to be released in the form of a stablecoin backed by gold (RACIB). Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath was excited at this news and tweeted, ""Iran and Russia to issue a new stablecoin backed by Gold. Damn, if this picks up could be day 1, event 1 of establishing a new economic order everywhere. No idea why it's getting no oxygen from the global press.""

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to an external variable, for example, if a stablecoin is pegged to the Indian rupee with 1:1 parity, this would mean that the value of one unit of the cryptocurrency shall remain Rs 1 and will not change with market volatility. The stablecoin intends to replace fiat currencies like the US dollar, the Russian ruble, or the Iranian rial, for cross-border transactions.

This @benhopper verified IG account was mistakingly suspended for the 2nd time this month. I've yet to receive any explanation from IG (last time I got an email from Meta apologising for the mistake). I'm honestly sick of this BS and can't assure you the future of this account.
I urge you all to follow my work elsewhere; Twitter and Telegram etc. but also my Email Newsletter (best option IMO) - all links can be found in my bio.
Give my other IGs a follow just in case: @benhopperdaily @benhoppersfw.

Amini's death later that day would unleash a wave of mass protests across Iran that were still persisting nearly three weeks later in different parts of the country, despite a government crackdown.

The photo of Amini's parents was also one of the last things Hamedi, worked for the pro-reform Sharq daily, would post before she was arrested some days later and her Twitter account listed as suspended.

""This morning, intelligence agents raided my client Niloofar Hamedi's house, arrested her, searched her house, and confiscated her belongings,"" Hamedi's lawyer Mohammad Ali Kamfirouzi tweeted on September 22.

Hamedi has not been charged and is being held in solitary confinement in Iran's Evin prison, he wrote.

The actual numbers are likely higher. The government has provided zero evidence to back up its claims about what happened at the prison, which is why we are not reporting their statements right now.

Today families of prisoners in Evin gathered outside the prison, as shown in this video. 

Since last night, some prisoners, including some political prisoners, were able to call their families to let them know their condition, but the prison has a capacity of 15,000 and could be over-capacity due to the high influx of protesters who were sent there in the past four weeks—this means thousands of families are potentially still waiting for information about their loved ones.

Prisoners in the women’s ward were reportedly attacked last night with tear gas, tweeted former political prisoner Atena Daemi while referencing her source inside the prison. Her tweets below have been translated into English by the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI):  “From a prisoner in the Women’s Ward: The siren was heard from 8:30 last night. Mohammadi, head of security, and Hayat-Algheib, head of State Prisons Organization, came to Evin Prison. [Inmates] broke the door and entered the outer area of the ward. Then they brought a sniper.” 

Follow up tweet: “Profanity was said. Prisoners without hijab chanted death to the dictator. They fired a lot of tear gas; some are still having lung problems today. Then [inmates] were guided inside the prison. At the moment everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”

There were more protests in Iran today, five weeks after Mahsa Amini, 22, was pronounced dead just days after she was arrested by the morality police.

At Tehran University today protesters chanted, “Tehran has become a prison! Evin has become a slaughterhouse!”

Repost from @amplifierart: 

Last week in Iran, 22 year old Mahsa Amini was brutally beaten and murdered by the Hijab “Morality” Police. Protests have sparked in the days since her murder, with many being injured and shot at by Police.  To limit the protests and prevent this from spreading, Iran has responded with Internet blackouts and Instagram blocks, and activists on the ground are calling for us ALL to use our social platform for good to get the word out and share this sad post with our followers — we must not allow Mahsa Amini’s death to be in vain!

""improper"" hijab.

The 22-year-old was arrested last Tuesday. Witnesses accuse officers of beating and striking Amini several times on the head. She was later taken to hospital in a coma and
died 3 days after. Although the Iranian authorities insist she had a fatal heart attack in custody, her family says she was in perfect health.

Thousands of anti-government demonstrators are taking to the streets after the harsh act of police brutality and violence, calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and abolishment of the 1981 law that requires all women to wear a headscarf and loose clothing.

Videos posted on social media show women burning their veils, while others cut their hair in a display of public defiance against lack of personal and political freedoms.

Dozens of cities are now affected by the unrest as the government calls on security forces, riot police, and the Basij (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) to subdue those
protesting.

Internet and mobile services have also been restricted in neighbourhoods amidst the crackdowns. According to NetBlocks (Via Twitter) Iran is now subject to the most
'severe internet restrictions' since November 2019 with Whatsapp and Instagram now being blocked.

It has also been reported that at least seven protesters had been killed as of Wednesday.

In her Instagram post, the 38-year-old actor had criticised international organisations for not speaking out against the execution of Shekari, reported AP. “Watching this bloodshed and not taking action, is a disgrace to humanity,” she wrote.

According to Iranian state media, Alidoosti was arrested because she did not provide any documents supporting her claims.

Both journalists are in great danger given Iranian intelligence agencies' cowardly attempts to pin the country's anti-state protests, which the Raisi government has been unable to crush, on the two women.

The intelligence agencies, both with documented histories of torturing and killing targets of the state, offered no evidence to justify their slander and incorrectly claimed that Niloufar had tweeted a photo of Mahsa Zhina Amini in the hospital, when she had only tweeted a photo of Amini's parents embracing in grief. Elahe, meanwhile, is being persecuted for reporting on Amini's funeral in Saqqez, Kurdistan province. In summary, these women journalists are being attacked for doing their jobs as journalists, which is legal even under the laws of the Islamic Republic.

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others
 
1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out
Use these tags when you post

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented

4. Organize to support iranians where you live 
Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country. DISCLAIMER: Due to sanctions against Iran, it is illegal to fundraise to send money there legally. If you see people collecting funds, be weary",,,,684,1.78,"@the.wellness.therapist :
to the international community, our sisters & brothers in iran have lost access to the internet. they are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. the regime of the islamic republic of iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. they are being killed in the dark. i humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard

iranians are asking for those outside of iran to their voice. share their stories. don’t let their deaths be in vain. scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others
 
1. repost footage of protests to all social media platforms

the islamic republic of iran regime is blocking the internet. iranians have to use vpn & other dangerous methods to get content out. when we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of iranians. they want us to help get their stories out

doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. footage being widespread online also raises morale of iranians to keep protesting

2. use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out
use these tags when you post
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #mahsa_amini #iran #iranprotests

According to the Geneva Convention, under no circumstances shall any health care worker be punished for carrying out medical activities, and persons engaged in medical activities shall not be compelled to carry out work contrary to the rules of medical ethics.

In the past few weeks, Iranian health care workers have been systematically subjected to harassment, intimidation, and threats from the Iranian government. They have been detained and tortured while in custody and forced to provide false statements under duress. They have been humiliated and abused, both physically and mentally. Our colleagues have been forced to flee their country solely due to caring for injured protesters, a task that is the very core of their profession.

We have clear goals for this movement, which are as follows: 
1. Immediate and unconditional release of physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and nurses. 2. Cessation of pursuit and arrest of the wounded protestors in forms of threats and harassment that prevent the delivery of prompt and quality care by the health care team. 4. Immediate cessation of violent attacks on health care workers while on duty. 5. Prohibit all security forces and plainclothes officers from entering hospitals or medical facilities, arresting injured protestors or the health care team who are assisting them. 6. Stop using ambulances as military vehicles carrying regime’s security personnel instead of injured patients.
We call on all human rights organizations and international communities to pressure the Islamic Republic of Iran, a signatory to the Geneva Convention treaties, to adhere to these treaties and hold it accountable otherwise.

according to the geneva convention, under no circumstances shall any health care worker be punished for carrying out medical activities, and persons engaged in medical activities shall not be compelled to carry out work contrary to the rules of medical ethics.

in the past few weeks, iranian health care workers have been systematically subjected to harassment, intimidation, and threats from the iranian government. they have been detained and tortured while in custody and forced to provide false statements under duress. they have been humiliated and abused, both physically and mentally. our colleagues have been forced to flee their country solely due to caring for injured protesters, a task that is the very core of their profession.

we have clear goals for this movement, which are as follows: 
1. immediate and unconditional release of physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and nurses. 2. cessation of pursuit and arrest of the wounded protestors in forms of threats and harassment that prevent the delivery of prompt and quality care by the health care team. 4. immediate cessation of violent attacks on health care workers while on duty. 5. prohibit all security forces and plainclothes officers from entering hospitals or medical facilities, arresting injured protestors or the health care team who are assisting them. 6. stop using ambulances as military vehicles carrying regime’s security personnel instead of injured patients.
we call on all human rights organizations and international communities to pressure the islamic republic of iran, a signatory to the geneva convention treaties, to adhere to these treaties and hold it accountable otherwise.

Binance said late Thursday a cross-chain bridge linking with its BNB Chain was targeted, enabling hackers to move BNB
 tokens off the network. So-called cross-chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another.

The company said it had worked with network validators — entities or individuals who confirm transactions on the blockchain — to pause creation of new blocks on BSC, suspending all transaction processing while a team of developers investigates the breach.

Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.

“An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC,” Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, said in a tweet Thursday evening.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”

BNB Chain has since resumed operations.

In total, hackers drained 2 million BNB tokens — about $570 million at current prices — from the network, Binance’s BNB Chain said in a blog post on Friday.

The hack was caused by a bug in the bridge’s smart contract that allowed hackers to forge transactions and send money back to their crypto wallet, according to crypto security firm Immunefi. Smart contracts are pieces of code on the blockchain that allow agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.

The value of BNB sank more than 3% Friday morning to $285.36 a coin, according to CoinMarketCap data.

An earlier estimate from the company placed the total amount withdrawn in a range of $100 million to $110 million. The company also said it managed to freeze $7 million of funds with the help of its security partners.

A Binance spokesperson told CNBC the company coordinated with BNB Chain validators to enact an upgrade. That meant that most of the funds remained in the exploiter’s crypto wallet, while about $100 million was “unrecovered.”

When you share about people being held in prison in Iran, specifically by name, you are helping save their life. 
Fame buys safety.

On Nov 24, the UN Human Rights Council @unitednationshumanrights voted for a Fact-Finding Mission, into examining the human rights abuses In
Iran. This puts even more pressure on the
regime to portray a good image internationally.
Since the UN vote, the regime in recent days has released hundreds of detainees like Katayoun Mahmoudifar. Some of these released detainees include a prominent human rights activist, a famous 
actress and two former footballers among others. 
Posting on social media is the BEST way to help! 
Iranians are begging us to keep posting so that the regime is put under pressure. The Islamic Regime of Iran knows the world is watching, and is afraid of being held accountable.

One of the slides has a TW. While it may feel overwhelming to read; please remember that it is reality for many Iranians. Turning our eyes away from their pain, is invalidating their suffering. When we are aware, we are able to amplify better. 

Reach out to Iranians you know in your community. All of them are undergoing severe mental distress. Send them love, strength and solidarity. Ask how you can support them better. Share posts that they are sharing & stand united with them.

There is nothing as isolating than to have your yoga teacher or fellow practitioner invalidate what you, or the people in your country are going through. If you are a non-Iranian reach out to your yoga teacher and ask him/her to share. 
Stand in Solidarity. 

Simultaneously, do stand in solidarity with people from across the world facing war, protests, oppression, systemic violence, ethnic cleansing, genocide, gender/religious/race & caste based violence, climate events…

Her family was informed of her death ten days later.
The late teenager’s family were not allowed to see the body and were only allowed to look at her face for a few seconds for identification purposes.
Shakarami’s mother and aunt saw that her nose had been smashed and her skull was broken. The official death certificate cited “multiple blows caused by a hard object” as the cause of death.
The death of the teenager enraged citizens and led to high school girls joining the anti-government protests in large numbers on October 4.
The Iranian authorities claimed she died due to falling from a height, however, Shakarami’s mother Nasrin accused the Iranian authorities of murdering her daughter and pressuring her to say that she died by suicide after she jumped from the roof of a building.
Her family planned to bury Shakarami in Khorramabad, on October 2, which would have been her 17th birthday. However, they alleged that the security forces pressured them into not holding a funeral service.
Reportedly, the late teenager’s aunt, Atash Shakarami, defied the security forces and posted about the funeral on Twitter and invited people to join the celebration of her niece’s “last birthday”. Shortly afterwards, she and her husband were arrested.
On October 5, Iranian state television aired interviews where Atash stated that the teenager fell from the roof. The interview was reportedly filmed while they were in government custody. Shakarami’s mother also claimed that her sister was “forced to make the confession and broadcast them”.
Her family further alleged that Shakarami’s body was stolen and buried in Hayat Ol Gheyb to prevent publicity and prevent her grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for protesters.

👉The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards warned protesters that Saturday would be their last day of taking to the streets, in the clearest sign that security forces may intensify their fierce crackdown on nationwide unrest. ⁠
⁠
Since the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police last month, Iran has been gripped by protests, posing one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution. ⁠
⁠
""Do not come to the streets! Today is the last day of the riots,"" Guards commander Hossein Salami said in some of the toughest language used in the crisis, which Iran's leaders blame on its foreign enemies including Israel and the United States. ⁠
⁠
""This sinister plan, is a plan hatched ... in the White House and the Zionist regime,"" Salami said. ""Don't sell your honor to America and don't slap the security forces who are defending you in the face."" ⁠
⁠
Iranians have defied such warnings throughout the popular revolt, in which women have played a prominent role. There were more reports of fresh bloodshed and renewed protests on Saturday. ⁠
⁠
Human rights group Hengaw reported security forces shooting students at a girls school in the city of Saqez. In another post, it said security forces opened fire on students at Kurdistan University of Medical Science, in the Kurdistan provincial capital of Sanandaj. ⁠

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by refusing to wear the hijab & peacefully protesting. The Islamic Republic of Iran regime has shut down their connection to the outside world. They’re being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories since they cannot. 

Iranians are asking for those on the outside to be their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain.

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians.

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as: 

#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics . get creative! 

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented. 

4. Organize to support iranians where you live  Go out in the streets & make some noise. Attend support rallies in your country.",,,,480,-17.1,"follow @_the.wellness.therapist for up-to-date info on what’s happening in iran (as well as a lot of other great info)

We went from 500-2000 likes on each post to barely 50. Not really a coincidence at this point. Where’s the humanity & #freespeech ? Guess it doesn’t exist in #meta 😏 Huge disappointment a community originally created to bring people together is keeping us all from helping one another. It’s not going to slow us down! Despite what is being said on MSM, our Iranian followers assure us that there was no abolishment of the morality police.

“All across Iran, protesters have been risking their lives to call for an end to the Islamic Republic’s violent repression,” said Ghaemi.

“The state’s attempts to crush peaceful protest through killings, arrests, and imprisonment is a prelude to more severe state violence against Iran’s citizenry, which can only be halted through strong, collective, international action,” he said.

* CHRI calls on the Islamic Republic to release a public accounting of all political prisoners and detainees and their whereabouts, as well as a public listing of all those who have been killed since September 16, 2022, when anti-state protests erupted in the country.

* CHRI also urges the international community, including government leaders, the UN, and bar associations across the world, to call on the government in Iran to release all detained protesters and political prisoners and halt its crackdown on peaceful dissent.

* The U.S. and its partners should also pursue the establishment of an urgent special session at the U.N. Human Rights Council so that governments can collectively address the violence against protesters and establish an investigative, reporting, and accountability mechanism for the Islamic Republic’s many serious crimes.

Protestors are reportedly chopping their hair, burning down the hijab, and dressing up as men to oppose the moral policing of police and the system. 
On social media, videos of Iranian women cutting their hair and burning their hijabs are spreading amid growing outrage. Iranian protesters also took to the streets with antigovernmental slogans at a gathering in Saqez, Amini’s hometown. The crowd came from nearing cities in Kurdistan province. The protestors raised slogans like Death to the dictator – a reference to Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while some women threw their headscarves. 
Videos shared on social media also showed protesters assembling near the University of Tehran. The crowd raised slogans like Woman, Life, Freedom. Thousands of Iranian women staged protest rallies in the capital on weekend. Police fired tear gas shells to resist the protest. 
The death of Amini in the custody of morality police has forced women to take to the streets in protest and put a spotlight on their repression. 
Amini died on 16 September, Friday after being detained by the police unit liable for enforcing the Islamic republic’s strict dress code for women. Reports say that she fell into a coma post-arrest in Tehran. Media reports stated a heart attack as a reason after being detained by the morality police.
Reportedly, Amini was thrashed by police when they detained her in the police van. However, police have denied the allegations, saying Amini had “suddenly suffered a heart problem”. Amini’s family claimed their daughter was perfectly healthy.
Amini’s death erupted the protest, but seeds of distress were already sown due to growing reports of repressive acts against women. Women over the age of seven have to strictly cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes as per Iran’s sharia law. 
President Ebrahim Raisi passed an order on July 5, to enforce the hijab law, which carved a new list of restrictions on how women can dress.

#US Soccer sparked uproar over the weekend after posting an Iranian flag without its Islamic Republic emblem on the federation's social media feeds in what it claimed was a gesture of solidarity with Iranian women protesters.

Berhalter told a press conference on Monday that the US players and coaching staff had been oblivious about the posts as he sought to calm tensions surrounding Tuesday's Group B game, where a place in the last 16 is at stake.

""Sometimes things are out of our control,"" Berhalter said. ""We're not focused on those outside things and all we can do is apologize on behalf of the players and the staff, but it's not something that we were a part of.

""We had no idea what US Soccer put out. The staff, the players, we had no idea. For us our focus is on this match and I don't want to sound aloof, or we're not caring by saying that.

""Of course our thoughts are with the Iranian people, the whole country, and everyone. But our thoughts are only on this match.""

Earlier, Iran state media called for the United States to be kicked out of the World Cup after the USA men's national soccer team (USMNT) deleted the emblem of the Islamic Republic in a post displaying upcoming matches in Group B for the World Cup.

The USMNT defended the move by telling CNN that it was to show “support for the women in #Iran fighting for basic human rights” but was never meant to last over 24 hours.

The change “was a one-time graphic,” the soccer federation told CNN. “We have the main flag on our website and other places.”

However, Iran state media said on Twitter that “by posting a distorted image of the flag of the Islamic Republic of #Iran on its official account, the #US football team breached the @FIFAcom charter, for which a 10-game suspension is the appropriate penalty.”

Monday’s failure of the Iranian athletes to sing the anthem was widely viewed as a demonstration of support for the protests that erupted in Iran after Mahsa Amin, a 22-year-old woman, died in police custody after being detained for not wearing her headscarf properly. ⁠

At least four Iranian current and veteran soccer players — Veria Ghafouri, Hossein Mahini, Parviz Broumand, and Hamidreza Ali Asgari — have been taken into custody on charges of participating in or supporting the popular protests. ⁠

Some of those supporting Iran at Friday’s game against Wales were reportedly nationals from countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Some social media users also reported the presence of many non-Iranian spectators, mainly foreign workers living in Qatar, holding the flags of the Islamic Republic. ⁠

People wearing clothes with slogans such as ""Freedom Life Woman"" or shirts with the name ""Mahsa Amini"" were also widely prevented from entering. ⁠

According to Cyber News, the hacked phone numbers, with their owner's names, are currently on sale on a dark web forum, potentially exposing users to phishing attacks and spam advertisement. 

It is currently impossible to figure out who was targeted by the attack, but the same source notes that the hack was allegedly possible through “scraping”, by collecting publicly accessible data on the internet, thanks to automated software such as when users fill out online forms.

However, RedRover believes deeply in the power of empathy as a guiding force for change and understands that animal suffering and human suffering are inextricably linked – and we stand with any people fighting for basic human rights and justice, in particular the rights and freedoms of women. In this vein, we want to acknowledge and support our Iranian-American staff member and all Iranians who are grieving the recent murder of Mahsa Zhina Amini, a young Kurdish Iranian woman who was taken into custody and beaten by the Iranian morality police for allegedly improperly wearing a hijab to cover her hair – a mandatory dress code for women in Iran regardless of their religious beliefs. There have been over a week of nationwide protests as the Iranian people unite to fight back against 43 years of oppression by an authoritarian regime that has stripped women of their rights and brutalized its own people with impunity.

This is not a political or religious issue, but a feminist and human rights imperative as this regime attacks its own. The government has disrupted internet access to suppress the voice of the people and prevent videos and updates from being shared with the world. In sharing this our hope is to help amplify the voices of the brave Iranians risking their lives to liberate themselves, and we invite you to share or raise awareness as well.

this is not a political or religious issue, but a feminist and human rights imperative as this regime attacks its own. the government has disrupted internet access to suppress the voice of the people and prevent videos and updates from being shared with the world. in sharing this our hope is to help amplify the voices of the brave iranians risking their lives to liberate themselves, and we invite you to share or raise awareness as well.

According to internal documents from the social media company, the campaign will advertise the Starlink satellite internet service, which is owned and operated by SpaceX, on Twitter in Spain and Australia. A Twitter ""takeover"" refers to the advertising campaign SpaceX is purchasing to advertise Starlink. According to two current and two former Twitter employees who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to speak on behalf of the company when a company purchases one of these packages, they typically spend upwards of $250,000 to place their brand at the top of the main Twitter timeline for a full day.

On the day or days of the anticipated takeover campaign in Australia and Spain, users should see Starlink brand messaging the first three times they open the Twitter app. The recently acquired campaign was planned to run in the upcoming days, first in Australia and then in Spain. According to current and past employees, SpaceX has not traditionally acquired significant advertising packages from Twitter.

Starlink uses a constellation of satellites to deliver internet to paying customers, who must also purchase terminals from SpaceX in order to use it. Starlink was created by SpaceX with the intention of bringing high-speed internet access to people in areas that are underserved or completely unserviced by cable or fibre-optic infrastructure.

📌 WHAT: Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Rights estimates that since September 17, at least 201 persons, including women and children, have been killed by Iran’s security forces and pro-government vigilante volunteers, during protests over the custodial death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.

🩸 Iranian security forces in Zahedan city have killed at least 90 people amid demonstrations against a police officer accused of rape in a separate case. The government has called the protesters “separatists”. 

🥀 Iran's Children's Rights Protection Society says at least 28 children have been killed. 

👉🏼 At least 1,200 people have been arrested, including at least 20 journalists, per Iran Human Rights. 

❗️Iran’s Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi told Iranian media on October 5 that the ""average age of the detainees from many of the recent protests was 15"". 

❗️❗️ In an interview with an independent  Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have been detained and referred to “psychological institutions” to be “reformed”. 

✊🏾 The women-led protests continue, 26 days on. They have now spread across Iran, with many activists calling the protests a national uprising. The rallying cry: Women, Life, Freedom. 

📷 The image in the post graphic has been sourced from Twitter, where people are crowdsourcing protest artwork, often anonymously from Iran. The image depicts the bleeding ear that can be seen in Mahsa Amini’s final photo from a hospital, right before she died, lending credence to eye witness claims and media reports that she was beaten by the morality policy after being detained for wearing her hijab ‘improperly’.

The billionaire who runs Tesla said that Starlink officials said they spend nearly $20 million a month for maintaining satellite services in Ukraine. Musk recently said that SpaceX had spent about $80 million to enable and support Starlink there. ⁠

""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable,"" Musk wrote Friday on Twitter. ⁠

""We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" Musk wrote. ⁠
⁠
CNN reported on Thursday that SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon last month saying it could not continue to fund the Starlink service in Ukraine, and it may have to stop funding it unless the U.S. military gives the company tens of millions of dollars a month. ⁠

Amou Haji – not his real name, but an endearing nickname given to elderly people, died on Sunday in the village of Dejgah, the New York Post reported, citing state media.

He was buried in Farashband City in Fars on Tuesday.

As per IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency), Haji had avoided showering over fears of “getting sick. However, for the first time a few months ago, “villagers had taken him to a bathroom to wash.”

According to New York Post Haji lived in isolation for most of his life in an open brick hut, which villagers made after he started sleeping in a hole in the ground.

Locals attributed Haji’s eccentricity to “emotional setbacks” in his youth. In 2014, the Tehran Times reported that Haji also avoided fresh food, opting instead for rotted porcupine, and smoked a pipe of animal excrement.

Reportedly, a short documentary film titled “The Strange Life of Amou Haji” was made about his life in 2013.

🎤 What we know: The morality police “has nothing to do with the judiciary and has been abolished by the same authorities who installed it.” This quote of the Attorney General Mohammad Javad Montazeri on Dec 3 at a meeting with officials to discuss the unrest, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA) was widely reported and interpreted by international and Indian news platforms, including us (post now removed), as Iran’s morality police being disbanded.

📌Since then: Iranians have taken to social media to dismiss this news as disinformation, calling it a throwaway remark that amounts to nothing on the ground, where the the Iranian government continues to suppress protestors through arrests, and violence.

📺 Arab-language Al-Alam state television has said that foreign media were depicting Montazeri’s comments as “a retreat on the part of the Islamic Republic from its stance on hijab and religious morality as a result of the protests”, but  all that could be understood from his comments was that the morality police were not directly related to the judiciary. ""No official of the Islamic Republic of Iran has said that the Guidance Patrol has been shut.""

❓What we don't know: 

👉🏼 If the Attorney General's statement will actually translate into the Morality Police being withdrawn.

👉🏼 Even if the morality police is disbanded, will the government take to other methods of enforcing compliance with Sharia laws?

👉🏼 Even if the morality police is disbanded, will it lead to a change in the strict Sharia laws on how women should dress and behave in public? 

👉🏼 The official stance of the government. Iran's Ministry of Interior is yet to issue a statement.

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting.

“Doctors who’ve spoken out against Islamic Republic forces occupying medical buildings and who are trying to treat wounded protesters are engaging in a courageous defense of the right to life and deserve international solidarity,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“Members of the medical community shouldn’t have to risk their lives to call on authorities to allow them to provide care in a safe environment, yet that’s what’s happening in Iran as we speak,” he added.

“The international medical community should join human rights groups in urgently calling on the Iranian government to allow doctors to protect human life without the threat of death or arbitrary arrest,” said Ghaemi. “And call for the immediate release of all detained medical workers.”

Many people in Iran who’ve been wounded amid the protests are too afraid to go to a hospital for treatment because protesters seeking medical help have been detained, according to several accounts shared with CBS News from both inside and outside Iran.

On October 25, members of the Tehran Medical Council issued a statement condemning state security forces patrolling medical buildings in search of protesters: “As members of the Tehran Medical Council, we condemn the military, police, security, and unidentified forces for entering medical universities and hospitals and demand that they stop.”

The statement also called “for the protection of the detainees and their families.”

“Woman, life, freedom”: It’s been more than a month since Zhina (Mahsa) Amini’s arrest by Iran's ‘morality police’ on September 13th. Three days later she died. Her death marked the beginning of anti-government protests which within days spread over the entire country.

Tomorrow, on Saturday, from 3–8pm, the ""Woman* Life Freedom Kollektiv"" is organising a large protest in Berlin to support the weeks-long resistance across an innumerable number of Iranian cities, standing up against oppression and discrimination in the Islamic Republic.

The Berlin protest will take the following route:

Begin 3pm:
Hofjägerallee (Antreteplatz) - Großer Stern - Spreeweg - John-Foster-Dulles-Allee - Yitzhak-Rabin-Str. - Str. des 17. Juni - Straße des 17. Juni / Großer Stern (Endplatz / ausschließlich Großer Stern)

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Islamic Republic of Iran, Javaid Rehman, will hold a briefing at the UN’s headquarters in New York on Oct. 27 to address the state of human rights in the country.

The conference will take place during the 3,944th meeting of the 136th session of the UN Human Rights Committee (CCPR).

Iran has been shaken  by nationwide protests since Sept. 16, following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Amini was detained by the country’s morality police for breaching the country’s strict female dress code, and died in custody.

Protests began as a show of resistance against Iran’s compulsory hijab laws, then grew into a collective call for regime change. The rallies entered their fifth week on Oct. 23 and now involve women and men; children; ethnic and religious minority communities; and workers.

More than 200 people — including at least 23 children — have been killed by government security forces, according to reports by organizations monitoring the protests.

The announcement of the UN briefing follows an Oct. 17 letter by the world’s leading human rights organizations asking the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session on Iran.

The letter to the UN was signed by 43 human rights groups, including: Human Rights Watch; Amnesty International; Article 19; the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran; the Center for Human Rights in Iran; Iran Human Rights; the Kurdistan Human Rights Network; and the Siamak Pourzand Foundation.

The letter said: “Given the gravity of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed in Iran and the prevailing systemic impunity [the council should establish] an independent, investigative, reporting and accountability mechanism.”",UN EXPERT ON IRAN TO HOLD HUMAN RIGHTS BRIEFING AMID NATIONWIDE PROTESTS Javaid Rehman,,,209,1.94,"by natasha phillips ((@sobukira))

The torture, to obtain forced confession, and sexual violence of those arrested have been reported widely and is a known fact. The UN, along with dozens of respectable Human Rights Organisations including Amnesty International, have exposed the brutal methods the IRI uses to suppress any protests and cry for basic freedom. I am worried that the Iranian regime is going to murder and execute more innocent people, therefore, I am announcing my political sponsorship of two young people accused of the vague and dubious crimes of “Moharebeh” or “Waging war against God” and “spreading corruption on earth” punishable by death. #ShirinMarashi and #BahmanBahmani. These are made up charges to intimidate and silence those who are opposing the regime. I will talk about them in my next two posts. The IRI must immediately end its torture of #ShirinMarashi and #BahmanBahmani and release them.

The hard fork — a blockchain upgrade that implements a major change to the network's underlying software — went through successfully at 4 a.m. ET on Wednesday at a block height of 22,107,423. It was mainly executed to implement a software patch that resolved a critical vulnerability exploited by an unknown attacker to steal more than $100 million from BNB Chain's cross-chain bridge last Friday.

The developer team announced the upgrade with a GitHub post on Tuesday, saying it would carry out a hard fork to deploy a patch and re-enable the network's “cross-chain infrastructure.”

This cross-chain bridge allows users to transfer assets between the two separate blockchains that fall under the BNB Chain network: Beacon Chain and Smart Chain. While BNB Beacon Chain handles the network's governance and staking, the Smart Chain is used as an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible smart contract platform to deploy apps. Both of these chains can connect to other third-party chains with the help of Token Hub bridge as well.

During the exploit, the perpetrator forged security proofs, leveraging a vulnerability tied to ""iavl hash check,"" a security check baked into the bridge. In this way, the hacker was able to mint 2 million BNB tokens out of thin air, worth around $560 million at the time. On-chain data shows that the hacker transferred more than $100 million out to third-party chains including Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum. The majority of the affected assets (nearly $430 million) remained in the hacker's wallet on the BNB Chain itself.

Posted @withrepost • @officiallyjoko Niloufar Hamedi, a Shargh newspaper journalist, is the journalist who for the first time reported the death of #MahsaAmini and her family’s words from inside Kasra Hospital in Tehran. She has been in detention since Sept 21, 2022. Elaheh Mohammadi, a Mihan newspaper journalist, is also another reporter in detention for going to Saqqez to investigate and report on Mahsa’s funeral.

Today, the Intelligence Ministry of the Islamic Republic and the Intelligence Service of IRGC published a joint-statement about recent protests in Iran and officially accused Niloufar and Elaheh to help the “foreign media” to propagate a biased narrative of what happened around Mahsa’a death. They were accused of doing so by publishing photos of her on the hospital bed (which showed head trauma) and reports of her funeral in Saqqez and people’s protest after that. In the statement, they claim that the two reporters has been trained on foreign soil to work for “the US mafia-like regime”. In recent days many reporters have been detained and are said to be kept in very harsh conditions in the prisons of Iran.

Several FTX workers acknowledged on Twitter to sleuth ZachXBT that they were unaware of the transfers.

FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller tweeted that the exchange was ""investigating abnormalities with wallet movements"" more than an hour after the alleged hack began.

He later pinned a message in FTX's official Telegram support channel that read: ""FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don’t go on FTX site as it might download Trojans.""

Throughout the chaos, the official FTX Twitter account was silent.

Miller's Twitter account posted a statement from FTX CEO John Jay Ray III on the afternoon of Nov. 12, confirming the hack and stating that company officials were in contact with law enforcement.

According to Bloomberg, the criminal probe is separate from the fraud case against ousted former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

The report further stated that officials were able to freeze a portion of the stolen money. @benzinga

Reposted from @apnews Noura’s determination to play sports was so great that she defied her family’s opposition for years.⁠
⁠
But the 20-year-old Afghan woman could not defy her country’s Taliban rulers. They have not just banned all sports for women and girls, they have actively intimidated and harassed those who once played, often scaring them from even practicing in private, Noura and other women say.⁠
⁠
A number of girls and women who once played a variety of sports posed for an @apnews photographer for portraits with the equipment of the sports they loved. They hid their identities with burqas, the all-encompassing robes and hood that completely cover the face, leaving only a mesh to see through. They didn’t normally wear the burqa, but they said they sometimes do now when they go outside and want to remain anonymous and avoid harassment.⁠
⁠
The ban on sports is part of the Taliban’s escalating campaign of restrictions that have shut down life for girls and women.⁠
Even before the Taliban, women’s sports were opposed by many in Afghanistan’s deeply conservative society, seen as a violation of women’s modesty and of their role in society. Still, the previous, internationally-backed government had programs encouraging women’s sports and school clubs, leagues and national teams for women in many sports.⁠

reposted from @apnews noura’s determination to play sports was so great that she defied her family’s opposition for years.⁠
⁠
but the 20-year-old afghan woman could not defy her country’s taliban rulers. they have not just banned all sports for women and girls, they have actively intimidated and harassed those who once played, often scaring them from even practicing in private, noura and other women say.⁠
⁠
a number of girls and women who once played a variety of sports posed for an @apnews photographer for portraits with the equipment of the sports they loved. they hid their identities with burqas, the all-encompassing robes and hood that completely cover the face, leaving only a mesh to see through. they didn’t normally wear the burqa, but they said they sometimes do now when they go outside and want to remain anonymous and avoid harassment.⁠
⁠
the ban on sports is part of the taliban’s escalating campaign of restrictions that have shut down life for girls and women.⁠
even before the taliban, women’s sports were opposed by many in afghanistan’s deeply conservative society, seen as a violation of women’s modesty and of their role in society. still, the previous, internationally-backed government had programs encouraging women’s sports and school clubs, leagues and national teams for women in many sports.⁠

AL RAYYAN, Qatar, Nov 27 (Reuters) – The United States Soccer Federation temporarily displayed Iran‘s national flag on social media without the emblem of the Islamic Republic as a show of solidarity with protesters in Iran ahead of the two teams’ World Cup clash on Tuesday.

A now-deleted graphic of the Group B standings posted on Saturday across U.S. Soccer’s official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts displayed a plain green, white and red flag.

Iran has been gripped by protests since 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death in September while in police custody after her arrest for flouting the country’s strict Islamic dress code.

The intent of the posts was to “support for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights”, U.S. Soccer media officer Michael Kammarman told a news conference on Sunday. Players were not consulted on the decision to alter the flag.

The banner on U.S. Soccer’s Twitter page was also changed on Saturday to feature the flag without the emblem. It was changed back 24 hours later to the banner they had been using during the tournament.

Iran‘s state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency said the Iranian Football Federation will file a complaint against U.S. Soccer to the FIFA Ethics Committee for “disrespecting the national flag” of the Islamic Republic.

Iranian leaders have accused the United States and other foreign adversaries of fomenting the protests in which Iranians from all walks of life have mounted one of the boldest challenges to the theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Washington has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials over the crackdown on protesters.

The United States and Iran will face off in a decisive Group B clash with their place at the World Cup on the line, in a match which was already freighted by decades of emnity between the nations.

To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.
 

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtAgs to get thE word out 

Use these tags when you post: 
#mahsaamini #jinaamini #zhinaamini #Mahsa_Amini #iran #iranprotests

The tags above are designed for those who are already aware of whats happening in Iran. To get the story out to those who aren’t aware of it, use other popular hashtags such as: 

#food #fall #halloween #family #love #photography #news #politics 

3. No war. No western intervention.
Keep your support focused on Iranian people fighting for their own liberation. Say No war on Iran. Iranians don’t want Western foreign intervention. They want to fight for their own liberation. They just want support from the international community. They want the atrocities documented.

Tap through these slides to understand. The IRI has mass executed thousands before. That level of brutality & terror is how they have held Iran hostage for 43+ years.

They currently have imprisoned MORE than 15,000 innocent people whose status is largely unknown because they don’t provide clear info. We don’t even know if some of these people have already been executed. Even after they murder people, they are known to keep their corpses from their family + promise to return the corpse if the family lies about the cause of death (“heart attack”, “suicide”, etc.) when they have been beaten to death by the IRI.

I and others have been saying the IRI will launch psychological + cyber warfare on us as we pull their heinous regime down. They want to distract us. This is all part of that.

Since when has Meta acted so swiftly over “fake news”? In less than 12 hours, posts shared by celebrities w/enormous followings were pulled. How come Meta didn’t challenge the actual fake news of the IRI stating Mahsa Amini’s death was due to a medical condition?

Around the world women are uniting in protest against the Iranian government by cutting their hair. The protests started after the death of Mahsa Amini who was arrested by Iranian morality police.

Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman from the Kurdish minority, was arrested on 13 September for what was perceived to be “improper” hijab. She fell into a coma shortly after collapsing at Vozara Detention Centre. Amini died three days later. There are reports Amini was beaten on the head with a baton, and her head was banged against a vehicle by the so-called morality police. 

In recent months, the morality police have expanded street patrols, subjecting women perceived to be wearing “loose hijab” to verbal and physical harassment and arrest. Thousands have taken to the streets in a number of cities across the country. Women are uniting in protest against the Iranian government by cutting their hair.

And learn about their remarkable stories of courageous journalism below:

In Iraqi #Kurdistan, freelance journalist Niyaz Abdullah @niyazabdulla faces legal harassment by security forces and local authorities, and she was detained and threatened with violence over her work. In 2021, she fled to France to escape threats against her.

In #Cuba, freelance journalist Abraham Jiménez Enoa @jimenezenoa was strip-searched and handcuffed, interrogated for five hours, and both he and his family threatened over his writings in October 2020. Cuban authorities’ threats of legal repercussions if he continued to publish, persistent harassment, and censorship forced Jiménez to flee to #Spain in 2021, where he is currently living in exile.

In #Ukraine, despite the dangers of war, death threats, and Russia’s declared ban on her publication, @ukr_pravda’s Editor-in-Chief, Sevgil Musaieva @sevvvgil, has worked relentlessly since the invasion to ensure the safety of her staff and to inform the public.

In #Vietnam, human rights reporter Pham Doan Trang, who also founded the independent legal magazine @luatkhoatapchi, is currently serving a nine-year sentence after a one-day trial on charges of making or spreading news against the state.

CPJ will also honor Russian journalist Galina Timchenko, editor of the independent news website @meduza_en, which she founded in 2014 after fleeing to Latvia.

The livestream of the event begins this evening at 7:45 p.m. EST / 4:45 p.m. PST / 12:45 a.m. GMT, and you can watch it on Facebook — the link is in our bio.

In November, millions of Iranians protested against a corrupt government. Hundreds were killed on the spot and many others arrested. Amirhossein Moradi, Mohammad Rajabi and Saeed Tamjidi were among those arrested, and were due to be executed, however, social media pressure has bought the protesters some more time. Many are protesting in the streets and the govt has cut the internet in some places.

These three had their death sentence reduced to prison time due to outcry. Now they remain in prison with thousands of prisoners from this phase of the revolution. As many as 3000 protesters died in 2019-2020, mostly in Bloody November. Those martyrs didn’t have the chance to know what a revolution would come…to see what they fought & gave their life for.

What Happened: Details of the hacking were shared by Alon Gal, co-founder and CTO of Israeli cybersecurity monitoring firm Hudson Rock in a LinkedIn post, first noted on Reuters.

Gal said the leaked email database was “circulating heavily"" and contains ""235,000,000 unique records of Twitter users, and their email addresses and will, unfortunately, lead to a lot of hacking, targeted phishing, and doxxing.""

Gal described it as one of the “most significant” leaks he has seen, adding that the leak would be used to target cryptocurrency Twitter accounts with Ethereum’s symbol in the name.

He said other adverse effects include hacking of high-profile and political accounts and attacks on accounts with good usernames.

Not Recent? The hacking could have taken place as far back as 2021, before Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk purchased Twitter, according to Reuters.

The scale of the breach is yet not clear with earlier accounts pegging the breach at 400 million email addresses. Follow @benzinga

Times and again you removed my posts on suffering of Palestinians. CBS never publishes those photos and clips. No Media outlet does. They are not considered humans. Now you do the same with posts on Iranians'suffering. Rest in Peace Orwell.

All my rather short life has been opening mouth to speak up followed by broken teeth, in the U.S. and in the Middle East, freedom of expression that expires with expression. The whole concept is a fallacy. Anybody is free to express, even in North Korea. Freedom AFTER expression matters. I will keep speaking up. Silence suffocates an outlier like me, not all those gone teeth. I do not need them.

Let me repeat what I wrote in that post: Crimes must be seen to be stopped.

Widespread anti-government demonstrations erupted in September after the death of young Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who had been detained by morality police for allegedly flouting the strict dress code imposed on women.
“We ask the judiciary to deal decisively with the perpetrators of these crimes and with all those who assisted in the crimes and provoked rioters,” 227 lawmakers from Iran’s 290-seat, hardline-led parliament said in a statement, according to state media.

The activist HRANA news agency said that 318 protesters had been killed in the unrest as of Saturday, including 49 minors. Thirty-eight members of the security forces had also been killed, it added.

State media said last month that more than 46 security forces, including police, had been killed. Government officials have not provided an estimate of any wider death count.

Iranian leaders have vowed tough action against protesters they have described as rioters, accusing enemies including the United States of fomenting the unrest.

Demonstrations continued in many cities on Sunday, from Tehran to the central city of Yazd and the northern city of Rasht, according to rights groups and videos on social media.

A video posted on Twitter showed protesters in southern Tehran after nightfall chanting: “Clerics get lost”.

Reuters could not verify the rights groups’ reports independently, or the social media posts and footage.

In the Kurdish city of Marivan, rights group Hengaw said security forces opened fire on crowds who had gathered after the funeral of another woman, Nasrin Ghaderi, to protest against her death.

DUBAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) – Iranian security forces intensified a crackdown on anti-government protests in several Kurdish cities on Monday, as demonstrations elsewhere in Iran spread into the country’s vital energy sector.
Protests have swept Iran since Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iran‘s Kurdish region, died on Sept. 16 while being held for “inappropriate attire”, marking one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.

While university students have played a pivotal role in the protests with dozens of universities on strike, unconfirmed reports on social media showed workers at Abadan and Kangan oil refineries and the Bushehr Petrochemical Project had joined in.

Iran‘s oil ministry was not immediately available to comment.

A combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and Bazaar merchants helped to sweep the clergy to power in the Iranian revolution four decades ago.

With U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran‘s oil exports over the country’s nuclear programme, analyst Karim Sadjadpour said large and sustained strikes among energy workers could bring the Islamic Republic to its knees.

“Iran is less dependent on oil as a percentage of GDP than they were in 1978, but energy exports are still the lifeblood of the economy,” said Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

China, Iran‘s biggest oil customer, is one of the few countries that continues to do business with Iran despite sanctions. But an oil workers’ strike, experts say, could mean there would be no oil to export, legally or illegally.

A video on Twitter showed dozens of workers had blocked the road to the Bushehr petrochemical plant, in Assaluyeh on Iran‘s Gulf coast, chanting “Death to the Dictator”.","‎fire and outdoor, ‎'‎Iran Toughens Crackdown as as Some Oil Workers Reported to Join Protests انا ALO‎'‎‎",,,107,-1.05,"by parisa hafezi

Iranian security forces stole the body of a 16-year-old protester, and buried her secretly in a village.

The family had planned to bury #Nika_Shakarami on Monday, but her body was snatched and buried in a village about 40km away. Nika went missing for 10 days after protesting in Tehran on 20 September.

In her last message to a friend she said she was being chased by security forces.

Nika's family finally found her body in a morgue at a detention centre in the capital. ""When we went to identify her, they didn't allow us to see her body, only her face for a few seconds,"" said Atash Shakarami, Nika's aunt.

Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday. Under duress the family agreed not to hold a funeral but security forces ""stole"" Nika's body from Khorramabad and buried it in the village of Veysian. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Khorramabad cemetery and chanted slogans against the government, including ""death to the dictator"" ,a reference to Khamenei.

Atash, who posted about Nika on her social media accounts, was arrested on Sunday when security forces raided her house

Protests have swept through the Islamic Republic for weeks following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by ""morality police"" and taken to a ""re-education center,"" allegedly for not abiding by the country's conservative dress code.

The ""unabated violent response of security forces"" in the country has led to the reported deaths of at least 277 people, Rehman added in an address to the UN Security Council, a figure backed by reports from human rights groups.

However, precise figures are impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm - and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists, reported CNN.

Rehman also referenced Iran's decision to hold public trials for 1,000 people arrested in connection to the ongoing protests, noting that some of the charges carry the death penalty.

Iranian state media - a mouthpiece for the government - has itself reported on the 1,000 or so people indicted in Tehran province for their alleged involvement in nationwide protests, reported CNN.

AL RAYYAN, Doha, Nov 25 (Reuters) – Iran’s coach and players put their stunning World Cup turnaround on Friday down to winning their own mental battles, amid growing public pressure on them to make a stand over a deadly crackdown on protests against their country’s clerical rulers.

Iran were headed for a goalless draw against Wales in Al Rayyan on Friday but scored twice deep in stoppage time to seal a last-gasp victory and keep alive their hopes of reaching the World Cup second round for the first time ever.

The preparations of Team Melli, a huge source of national pride, have been disrupted by a crisis back home following the death in police custody of a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman in September. Her death sparked protests that have grown to represent the boldest challenge to the legitimacy of Iran’s clerical elite since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

“We talk about the players, their goals. I don’t have words to congratulate my players, they were brilliant,” coach Carlos Queiroz told a news conference.

“We played with amazing, amazing character, which is the profile of our team usually. We always play with a sense of unity, cohesion, always. Today we made it very clear football is a game of different moments.”

Iran were thrashed 6-2 in their opening Group B match against England on Monday, after which Queiroz vented fury over what he called harassment and political pressure on his team, who have faced criticism at home for not speaking out strongly over the deaths of protesters.

Many Iranians had hoped the team would use their high profile and the World Cup as a platform to show their solidarity. On Monday, they declined to sing their national anthem in an apparent show of support, but on Friday, they sang quietly as it was played at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, where boos and jeers were heard from Iranian supporters.",Soccer Amazing' Iran Defeat Wales in World Cup,,,84,1.09,"by martin petty

Sept. 13 – Mahsa Amini, from Iran‘s Kurdistan region, is detained by morality police in Tehran, the Iranian capital, because of her “inappropriate attire”.

Sept. 16 – Amini dies after falling into a coma. Police say she suffered a heart attack after being taken to a station to be “educated”. Her family deny she had any heart problems. Her father later says she had bruises on her legs, and holds police responsible for her death. President Ebrahim Raisi demands an investigation. Protests begin on social media and in the street.

Sept. 17 – Protests erupt during Amini’s funeral in Saqez, her hometown in Kurdistan. Security forces fire tear gas. Protests spread to the provincial capital. Chants of “death to the dictator” are heard, with some women removing headscarves.

In a video statement shared by her brother prior to her arrest, Farideh Moradkhani, a well-known rights activist, asked the leaders of other nations “stop any dealings with this regime”.

""O free people, be with us and tell your governments to stop supporting this murderous and child-killing regime,"" Ms Moradkhani said in the video. ""This regime is not loyal to any of its religious principles and does not know any rules except force and maintaining power.""

“Now in this critical moment in history, all of humanity is observing that Iranian people, with empty hands, with exemplary courage and bravery are fighting with the evil forces,” she said. “At this point in time, the people of Iran are carrying the burden of this heavy responsibility alone by paying with their lives.”

Mr Khamenei’s office has not issued a statement so far.

Her brother, Mahmoud Moradkhani, who presents himself as “an opponent of the Islamic Republic” on Twitter, reported on 23 November that Ms Moradkhani was arrested as she was heeding a court order to appear at the Tehran prosecutor’s office.

According to the activist website Hrana, she was taken to Tehran’s Evin security prison and faces a 15-year prison sentence on unspecified charges.

Her father, Ali Moradkhani Arangeh, was a Shi’ite cleric married to Mr Khamenei’s sister and recently passed away in Tehran following years of isolation due to his stance against the Islamic Republic, according to his website.

Iran has been observing a series of protests sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, after she was arrested for inappropriate attire. The demonstrators are now posing one of the strongest challenges to the country’s clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

We are writing to raise our deep concerns about the Iranian authorities’ mobilization of their well-honed machinery of repression to ruthlessly crackdown on current nationwide protests.

The United Nations Human Rights Council should act as a matter of urgency by holding a special session and — given the gravity of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed in Iran and the prevailing systemic impunity — establish an independent, investigative, reporting and accountability mechanism.

The recent protests were sparked by outrage at the death in custody of Mahsa (Jina) Amini, a 22 year old woman from the Kurdish minority, on 16 September 2022 days after being arrested by the “morality” police for not complying with the country’s discriminatory and abusive compulsory veiling laws, which perpetuate violence against women and girls in Iran and strip them of their right to dignity and bodily autonomy. The focus of the protests has since quickly expanded to broader grievances and encompassed demands for fundamental political and social change towards protection and fulfilment of human rights.

Evidence gathered by a number of the undersigned organizations shows a harrowing pattern of Iranian security forces deliberately and unlawfully firing live ammunition and metal pellets, including birdshot, at protesters and bystanders including children. Undersigned organizations are documenting growing numbers of protesters and bystanders killed, with some already reporting over 200 deaths, including at least 23 identified children, in Sistan and Baluchistan, Kurdistan and other provinces throughout Iran, as well as hundreds of others injured to date in the ongoing crackdown. The actual numbers, though, are likely to be much higher and growing.

Iranian media and a local prosecutor said four people were killed in the last two days, bringing the total death toll according to official sources to eight, including a member of the police and a pro-government militia member. 

The demonstrations erupted over the death in detention last week of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iranian Kurdistan who was arrested in Tehran for “unsuitable attire”.

The protests, which were concentrated in Iran’s Kurdish-populated north-western regions but have spread to at least 50 cities and towns nationwide, are the largest since a wave of demonstrations in 2019 over gasoline price rises.

Reports from Kurdish rights group Hengaw, which Reuters could not verify, said 10 protesters had been killed. Three died on Wednesday, adding to the seven people the group said had been killed by security forces. 

Officials have denied that security forces have killed protesters, suggesting they may have been shot by armed dissidents.

With no sign of the protests easing, authorities restricted access to the internet, according to accounts from Hengaw, residents, and internet shutdown observatory NetBlocks. 

Activists expressed concern that the internet shutdown echoed a government move before a crackdown against the 2019 fuel price protests, when Reuters reported that 1,500 people were killed.

NetBlocks and residents said access had been restricted to Instagram – the only major social media platform that Iran usually allows and which has millions of users – and that some mobile phone networks had been shut down. 

“Iran is now subject to the most severe Internet restrictions since the November 2019 massacre,” NetBlocks said. 

Amini’s death unleashed anger over issues including freedoms in the Islamic Republic and an economy reeling from sanctions.

Women have waved and burnt their veils during protests, with some cutting their hair in public.

officials have denied that security forces have killed protesters, suggesting they may have been shot by armed dissidents.

with no sign of the protests easing, authorities restricted access to the internet, according to accounts from hengaw, residents, and internet shutdown observatory netblocks. 

activists expressed concern that the internet shutdown echoed a government move before a crackdown against the 2019 fuel price protests, when reuters reported that 1,500 people were killed.

netblocks and residents said access had been restricted to instagram – the only major social media platform that iran usually allows and which has millions of users – and that some mobile phone networks had been shut down. 

“iran is now subject to the most severe internet restrictions since the november 2019 massacre,” netblocks said. 

amini’s death unleashed anger over issues including freedoms in the islamic republic and an economy reeling from sanctions.

women have waved and burnt their veils during protests, with some cutting their hair in public.

People demonstrated in London and Paris and elsewhere on Saturday in solidarity with Iranian protesters, some holding pictures of Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the Islamic Republic’s morality police for “unsuitable attire”.

Pleasant woman accused of engaging in a sophisticated catfishing campaign of harassment that targeted two teens one of them her own daughter, was charged with five crimes, including one that accused her of attempting to frame another student.

The 42-year-old Kendra Gail Licari, was charged Monday afternoon with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit a crim£ and one count of obstruction of justice. 

The obstruction charge alleges that Licari attempted to frame another minor for her actions during the investigation.

Licari was arrested Monday after an investigation that started with a report to officials with the Beal City Schools of a cyberbullying complaint involving Licari’s daughter and the boy she was seeing at the time. Licari’s daughter attends Beal City Schools.

Licari and the mother of the other student worked with school officials to figure out the source of the harassment, David Barberi, Isabella County Prosecutor, said Monday.

Licari is accused of having used virtual private networks to mask the location she was sending messages from, Barberi said. When kids the age of the two traveled, she made it appear as if the messages were coming from the location they were at.

She also use a specific identity but instead tried to make them look like they were coming from age-peers of the two teens. That included using slang and abbreviations associated with communicating by text.

Barberi said on Monday that his office compiled 349 pages of harassing text and social media messages during the course of the investigation.

(Swipe For Back Up Story)

 A few said that the d€ath penalty was 'imposed' on 15000, the false claims started floating on social media platforms after human rights groups estimated that 15000 protestors were detained in Iran over the protests that followed the d€ath of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, who was detained by Iran's powerful Guidance Patrol or morality police, for not wearing hijab.

Amini di€d under mysterious circumstances triggering nationwide protests against the government. 

Following the reports by human rights organizations, many celebrities and even government officials from some countries expressed dismay over the 'imposition' of d€ath penlty on Iranian protestors.

Celebrities such as Peter Frampton ,Nigerian celebrities and host of others who didn’t verify before sharing has fueled the false narrative that Iran sentences 15,000 protestors to d€ath as a 'hard lesson' for all rebels.

However only one Iranian protester was sentenced to d€ath on 13 Nov 2022, for setting fire to a government building, disturbing public order, conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, waging war against God and corruption on earth', one of the most serious offences under Iranian law, the judiciary's Mizan Online website reported. 

This is the first known use of capital punishment for participation in an anti-regime 'riot'. 

The sentence is the latest attempt by the Iranian government to suppress the protests which have swept the country since the death of 22-year-old.

Another court in Tehran sentenced five others to prison terms of between five and ten years for 'gathering and conspiring to commit crimes against national security and disturbing public order'.

Recall back in September 22,Hallesblog shared the story of late Mahsa Amini who mysteriously di€d.

Since the major wave of anti-regime protests in 2009, many Iranian #women have consciously pushed the envelope on the Islamic Republic’s austere, misogynistic #dress code, adjusting their hijabs to show strands of hair or applying light #makeup to their faces. Since Amini allegedly did something along these lines with her head covering, she was savagely beaten while in #police custody, losing consciousness and dying of her injuries on Sept. 16, having spent three days in a #coma.

The regime’s official explanation is that Amini—by all accounts, a healthy young woman with no pre-existing respiratory or #cardiac conditions—died of a heart attack after “suddenly” developing a problem. Few people are buying that, of course, least of all Amini’s family. In a heartbreaking interview with the BBC’s #Persian language service, Amini’s grieving father, Amjad, accused the #regime of “telling lies,” adding, “No matter how much I begged, they wouldn’t let me see my daughter.”

When Amjad Amini was finally allowed to see Mahsa’s lifeless body, it had been covered entirely from neck to toe, although he noticed the bruising on her feet. “I have no idea what they did to her,” he wept, with the unique agony of a bereaved #parent.""

The United Nations Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Nov. 24 to address “the deteriorating human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to a council press release. The meeting is the first of its kind on Iran.

Special sessions at the UN are held to discuss important topics. They are considered high-level events, and involve heads of state and government as well as cabinet ministers. Proposed sessions can only be approved if they have the support of one-third of the 47 members of the council.

The decision to hold the meeting comes after a Nov. 11 request by Germany and Iceland. The resolution has been supported by 44 member states so far, as well as 27 supporter states including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The list of signatories remains open until the session takes place, enabling additional states to support it in the days leading up to the meeting.

The meeting comes after an Oct. 27 briefing by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Islamic Republic of Iran, Javaid Rehman at the UN headquarters that addressed human rights violations in the country during the recent protests.

Demonstrations erupted in mid-September in Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while she was in the custody of the country’s morality police. The protests, which have now gone on for more than 60 days, have turned into a countrywide call for regime change, led by women, men, and children; ethnic and religious minorities; and oil and factory workers.

During the 30-minute briefing on Oct. 27, Rehman said Amini was “a victim of state brutality and state repression,” and that protesters were “seeking justice. They are seeking accountability.” Rehman confirmed that the UN had received several reports of women and children killed by state authorities in Iran and that the international community had a responsibility to address allegations of human rights violations by Iran’s regime.",UN Human Rights Council to Hold First-Ever First- Special Session on Iran บา,,,44,-1.82,"by natasha phillips

This also made movements durable, instilling discipline and chains of command. Social media allows would-be protesters to skip those steps… Without that traditional activist infrastructure, social media protests are less equipped to endure government repression… ‘We live in an age of digital authoritarianism’... Dictatorships, seizing on the internet and other tools, have developed new methods from direct surveillance of activists’ communications to online harassment and intimidation to the rapid diffusion of state propaganda to the infiltration of movements to selective censorship.” End excerpt.

The nationwide protests, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in September in the custody of morality police, have been at their most intense in western provinces where the majority of Iran‘s 10 million Kurds live.

NetBlocks, which tracks connectivity around the world, tweeted that mobile internet was cut off for many users in Iran amid a new wave of protests and reports of casualties.

This piece is taken from a music-album that is ongoing-composition, and is now during the pre-order on Noise à Noise, too. “Politics-Aesthetics II: Becketts Quad Variations”. This is the second collection among a few albums with similar titles and numbers in sequence that he has composed, or have planned for composition throughout the next season; similar to the previous album, it is an ongoing project, too. An album that is under development, but won't be pending the release as the pieces are going to gradually appear here on Bandcamp on a weekly basis during the pre-order period. 

Ehsan Saboohi is a composer and music theorist, he considers himself a post-orientalist composer, a term he has coined to describe a music language for analyzing the aesthetics of his and his colleagues’ compositions. He demands a different language of common Contemporary Classical music trends by taking inspiration from the philosophical-social ideas of the famous philosopher Edward Said.
“Post-Orientalism is a modern music language that uses microtonal sounds and intervals alongside altered sound chain and block structures to achieve a post-orientalism musical piece in different acoustic and electroacoustic compositions.”

The facts of Amini’s death have quickly become irrelevant amid the widening fight against police violence, the repressive laws against women, and the disastrous trend in economic conditions.

On the morning of October 10, the workers of the oil sector acted upon their warnings to Tehran and a strike began after workers at the Asaluyeh Complex in the Bushehr province walked out. Hours later they were followed by fellow petroleum workers in Abadan, Khuzestan who went on strike in solidarity. Videos posted on social media show workers chanting ‘This year is the year of blood, Seyed Ali Khamenei is done!’ and ‘Down with the Dictator’ in front of government buildings. Similar videos that show workers chanting ‘Long live Iran! Long live Lurs, Turks, Kurds, Arabs and Bakhtiari’s!’ demonstrate the noble internationalism of the Iranian proletariat. It has been additionally reported that drivers of bitumen tankers have also begun striking, further extending the scope of the opposition. One video shows Iranian government workers being jeered-at by schoolgirls, and 5 leading Iranian economists have criticised the government’s response to the protests.

The workers of Iran are forced into increasing militancy by the repressive laws and policing of the theocratic government. After years of increasing unemployment, repression, immiseration, hunger and thirst, the promises of the ruling clique in Tehran become hollow. But the people still face enormous hurdles. There is not a functioning workers’ party in the country and socialists are heavily oppressed, the masses are therefore directionless. This can be seen by the movement itself, there is no single organisation that leads these people and the protests are therefore overall spontaneous and rudderless. What will inevitably follow is either the increasing repression of these protests, or their co-option towards reform and dissolution.

Now it’s even easier than before to go between Monero, Wownero, Litecoin, and Bitcoin.
What fundamental quality of sound money does physical cash, gold, silver, Monero, and Wownero all have in common?
A: FUNGIBILITY.
Bitcoin, Litecoin and 99% of all other “cryptos” are NOT FUNGIBLE.
Monero and Wownero are 2 of the very few exceptions, these 2 cryptos are “digital cash” because they are fungible.
Monero is the time-tested, battle-ready, king of mathematically scarce sound money digital cash.

now it’s even easier than before to go between monero, wownero, litecoin, and bitcoin.
what fundamental quality of sound money does physical cash, gold, silver, monero, and wownero all have in common?
a: fungibility.
bitcoin, litecoin and 99% of all other “cryptos” are not fungible.
monero and wownero are 2 of the very few exceptions, these 2 cryptos are “digital cash” because they are fungible.
monero is the time-tested, battle-ready, king of mathematically scarce sound money digital cash.
wownero is his little brother born in 2018.

Each round, once fired, releases tens of small metal pellets. The ammo is called ""BirdShot"" rounds.

A facade militia group in Iraq has claimed an attack on a an American convoy today (19/01) in the Yusufiya township of Baghdad. The name of the group that claimed responsibility is Al-Muqawama Al-Duwaliya, or the International Resistance. This is not a real group. Analysts believe that it is a front set up by Harakat H3zbollah al-Nuj4ba, a large(ish) militia with very close ties to Iran.

The organisation claimed the attack at 01:00 local time, 30 minutes after the attack took place. Sabereen News, which is a pan-PMF outlet with IP servers based in Kermanshah, Iran, was the first to report on the attack at 00:37. From that time onwards until today, twitter bots and supporters of the PMF (particularly those fond of HHN) have been spreading this news. 

The United States has not commented, this may be because no attack actually happened. The only traditional media outlets to report on the attack are Iranian funded/ pro-Iran outlets such as ‘iranpress.com’. They may receive orders to publish stories like this.

Whether or not the attack actually happened is actually irrelevant, HHN (or perhaps a different PMF group) have given birth to the idea that an attack happened against a US convoy in Iraq, which for them is a win. HHN and other PMF factions want to be seen as actively confronting the US presence in Iraq. Iraqi trust in traditional media outlets is at an all time low and militias take advantage of this by spreading their disinformation campaigns to build narratives.

""Starlink is losing money"" despite other companies ""getting billions in taxpayer $,"" he complained.

But Musk then followed up the tweet with a more promising message about doing good deeds.

""No good deed goes unpunished,"" one user replied.

Musk answered, ""Even so, we should still do good deeds.""

Musk's tweets seem to suggest that SpaceX will go on funding the satellite internet service used in support of Ukraine during its war with Russia, despite reports earlier this week that SpaceX has asked the Pentagon to take over paying for it.

However, it remains unclear if the aerospace company will continue its efforts.

According to documents obtained by CNN, a September letter from SpaceX to the Pentagon alleged that funding Starlink could cost Musk's aerospace manufacturer nearly $400 million over the next year.

Early Friday morning, Musk tweeted, ""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households.""

""This is unreasonable,"" he added.

His statement echoed SpaceX's letter to the Pentagon, CNN reported.

""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,"" SpaceX's director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon, according to CNN.

Starlink is a satellite constellation that provides internet connection to regions without stable telecommunications infrastructure, according to international broadcaster Deutsche Welle.

Not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, SpaceX sent thousands of Starlink terminals to Kyiv to allow Ukrainian soldiers and civilians to maintain internet connection. The aid came at the request of Ukraine's digital minister Mykhailo Fedorov during the early months of the war, Insider reported.

This is 16-year-old Nika Shakarami. They had plans to move to Germany with their girlfriend. They loved the color black, Halloween, and anime. Nika loved art and would frequently post their drawings on their Instagram, which has since been deleted by Iranian officials after their involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests.

On September 20th, Nika bravely joined a protest occurring in Tehran and was seen lighting their hijab on fire in response to the mandatory hijab restrictions in Iran. They were chased, cornered, and captured by military personnel before being taken to the infamous Iranian Elvin Prison. Ten days after Nika’s kidnapping, their family was finally informed by the government that they had died due to “falling from a great height.” After IDing their body, their family reportedly stated that the blows to their skull were comparable to injuries sustained from heavy beatings or torture and that they had experienced sexual abuse while in custody. In an effort to silence Nika’s family, Iranian authorities have so far arrested their aunt and uncle and have threatened the rest of their family’s safety. 

Since the murder of Mahsa Amini by the hands of the Iranian military in September, @iranhumanrights reports that at least 476 people have died from militia beatings, gun violence, or state-sanctioned executions. Nika is one of many children who are currently losing their lives fighting for a chance at equality and equity. It is up to us to be the voice that keeps her story alive and continues the work towards freedom for all Iranian women and people.

Last week, we overturned Meta's original decision to remove a Facebook post protesting the Iranian government, containing the slogan ""marg bar Khamenei."" As part of our recommendations, we told Meta to permit the general use of the slogan on its platforms during protests in Iran, which they fully implemented effective today.

The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression, and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. It is vital that Meta supports users' voice. ""Marg bar"" is used as a political slogan in Iran to mean ""down with,"" not as a credible threat.

We will continue to closely scrutinize how Meta implements recommendations made in the ""Iran slogan protest"" case, and related recommendations issued in decisions since and share updates of our assessment in our quarterly transparency reports. 

We look forward to receiving Meta's other responses to our recommendations in this case ahead of the 60-day deadline.

Khamenei.” This literally translates as “death to Khamenei” but is often used as political rhetoric to mean “down with Khamenei.” 

In the Iranian context, the Board finds that Meta must do more to respect freedom of expression, and permit the use of rhetorical threats. The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. In such situations, it is vital that Meta supports users’ voice. 

The content in this case was posted days before Iran’s “National Day of Hijab and Chastity"". Given the national day was approaching, Meta should have anticipated issues around the over-removal of Iranian protest content, and prepared an adequate response. For example, by instructing “at-scale” reviewers not to remove content containing the “marg bar Khamenei” slogan.

As this case shows, its failure to do so led to the silencing of political speech aimed at protecting women’s rights, including through feature-limits, which can shut people out of social movements and political debate.

The Board has made recommendations to better protect political speech in critical situations, such as that in Iran, where historic, widespread, protests are being violently suppressed. This includes permitting the general use of “marg bar Khamenei” during protests in Iran.

the content in this case was posted days before iran’s “national day of hijab and chastity"". given the national day was approaching, meta should have anticipated issues around the over-removal of iranian protest content, and prepared an adequate response. for example, by instructing “at-scale” reviewers not to remove content containing the “marg bar khamenei” slogan.

as this case shows, its failure to do so led to the silencing of political speech aimed at protecting women’s rights, including through feature-limits, which can shut people out of social movements and political debate.

the board has made recommendations to better protect political speech in critical situations, such as that in iran, where historic, widespread, protests are being violently suppressed. this includes permitting the general use of “marg bar khamenei” during protests in iran.

ENGLISH VERSION

Iranian people have been proesting for weeks against the brutal regime of the Islamic Republic. Against the systematic oppression of women and the mandatory headscarf. 
They protest and risk their own lifes. For Freedom. 
The regime's rulers block the Internet and prevent journalists from reporting. So they can break up the protest without any notice from worldwide attention.
But the protests continue. They write songs. They paint pictures. 
They bypass blocks and bans, they post videos and pictures of their protest online. 
They want the world's attention. So what can we do to make sure that people in Iran are seen? We can at least give our attention. #IranRevolution #JKLive

Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday the widespread protests following the death in police custody of the young woman last month are not the actions of “ordinary Iranians” as he accused the United States and Israel of planning the demonstrations. 
The protests, now in their third week, have been met with a crackdown by police and security forces. A tally of government statements compiled by The Associated Press gave a death toll of at least 14 people with 1,500 arrests, while rights groups say at least 130 are dead with thousands arrested. 
Khamenei said the death of 22-year-old Amini was a “sad incident” and that he was heartbroken. 
Iran’s morality police arrested Amini in Tehran for allegedly not following the country’s strict dress code and she died in a hospital three days later after falling into a coma. 
The government said she died of a heart attack. Her family rejected that account, saying Amini had no history of heart problems and that she was instead beaten. They called for accountability.

For the longest time, I have stared at Panic Cycles that were due the week of November 7th. I had assumed that this Panic Cycle was a warning that the US midterm election will be a traumatic event for neither side will accept the result. However, there is something else that has come on the radar with the West's constant harassment of Russia as the media seems to be intent on insulting Russia and praying for its demise. If you keep calling someone names and saying you are a loser, what will often happen is you provoke them into one of those events where they just start throwing punches and a brawl begins. All the press constantly put out the propaganda that Putin's invasion was unprovoked. I can confirm this was all intentional and the killing of both Nord Stream pipelines last week was part of the strategy to separate Germany from Russia. It is about the collapse of debt structures and the Great Reset.

The media will also not address how the deal was Ukraine was to remain neutral, yet Zelensky pushed for NATO membership. Then on February 23rd, Zelensky the day before Putin's invasion publicly stated Ukraine would seek nuclear weapons. This is the Western Press' propaganda when in fact this has been a provoked event to overthrow Russia for the Great Reset and to impose climate change directives to shut down their energy production which was 50% of the GDP. This was also to break the energy tie of Europe to Russia.

They are pushing Russia too hard and the Russian Neocons are clamoring for Putin to get serious. I do not see a major nuclear attack, but I cannot rule out a tactical nuclear weapon. Zelensky appears to be only interested in how much money he can stash offshore and has led his country to the brink of total destruction. Running to NATO for immediate membership is inviting a nuclear attack now.

As they say - What Will Be - Will Be.  We may see European conflict erupt going into 2023, but it still appears that we will be looking at World War III with China  joining Russia post-2024.

Binance Smart Chain temporarily suspended transactions and fund transfers, after detecting what it said was an exploit on a bridge between two blockchains. Activity resumed on the blockchain early Friday, a Binance spokesman said.

Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s chief executive, said on Twitter that the issue involved BSC Token Hub, a so-called cross-chain bridge. These enable the transfer of digital assets and information from one independent blockchain to another.

“The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe,” Mr. Zhao wrote, apologizing for the inconvenience.

Ransomware attacks are increasing in frequency, victim losses are skyrocketing, and hackers are shifting their targets. 

A spokesman for Binance said initial estimates for funds taken off the Binance Smart Chain are between $100 million and $110 million.

Binance Coin fell 3.4% from its level 24 hours prior to $284.56, according to CoinDesk data.

Cross-chain bridge hacks have become a common occurrence. In August, attackers drained $190 million worth of crypto from cross-chain bridge Nomad after a hacker exploited a vulnerability in an upgrade to the platform. So far this year, about $2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen in cross-chain bridge hacks, according to blockchain data firm Chainalysis.

(The Conversation) Images of the protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Zhina Amini on Sept. 16, 2022, in Iran and reports of the government’s brutal crackdown have circulated widely on social media. This flow of information comes despite efforts by the Iranian regime to throttle internet access and censor information leaving the country.

One effective method the protesters have hit on has been to use TikTok, the video-sharing app better known for young people posting clips of themselves singing and dancing. The way video clips are shared on the social media platform and the protesters’ clever use of labeling have helped activists circumvent the information blockade of Iran’s tech-savvy security services and reach a wide audience.

As a researcher who studies young people and participatory culture – art and information produced by nonspecialists, including fan fiction and citizen journalism – I believe that TikTok is proving to be an effective tool of political activism in the face of severe repression.

🏜 As high temperatures, droughts, and water scarcity made Iraq the world’s fifth most vulnerable country to “climate breakdown” according to the United Nations, Jusoor Post conducted an interview with Sahar Hussein Al Jassem, Deputy Chief of the Iraqi National Center of Climate Change (#NCCC) at the Ministry of Environment, on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) that was held in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh on November 6-19.

🏜 Jassem, who is a member of a 100-member delegation that attended #COP27, told Jusoor Post that Iraq has asked for $100 billion in its Nationally Determined Contribution (#NDC) report to be distributed to the development of 13 sectors. “The priority sectors include food and water security, health, climate risks, ecological systems, and energy. We will work on these five sectors in the period between 2020 and 2025,” she said.

🏜 Consequently, in a way to convince the major financial climate institutions that Iraq is strongly in need of financing in order to be able to adapt to these climate crises, the Iraqi negotiating delegation at the COP in Sharm El-Sheikh included for the first time representation from the Iraqi parliament.

🏜 “It is the first time that the delegation includes representatives from the parliamentary committee of health and environment, because we count on COP27 when it comes to financing,” she added, noting that a series of meetings took place with financial institutions like Global Environment Facility (#GEF).

🏜 as high temperatures, droughts, and water scarcity made iraq the world’s fifth most vulnerable country to “climate breakdown” according to the united nations, jusoor post conducted an interview with sahar hussein al jassem, deputy chief of the iraqi national center of climate change (#nccc) at the ministry of environment, on the sidelines of the 2022 united nations climate change conference (cop27) that was held in the egyptian city of sharm el-sheikh on november 6-19.

🏜 jassem, who is a member of a 100-member delegation that attended #cop27, told jusoor post that iraq has asked for $100 billion in its nationally determined contribution (#ndc) report to be distributed to the development of 13 sectors. “the priority sectors include food and water security, health, climate risks, ecological systems, and energy. we will work on these five sectors in the period between 2020 and 2025,” she said.

🏜 consequently, in a way to convince the major financial climate institutions that iraq is strongly in need of financing in order to be able to adapt to these climate crises, the iraqi negotiating delegation at the cop in sharm el-sheikh included for the first time representation from the iraqi parliament.

🏜 “it is the first time that the delegation includes representatives from the parliamentary committee of health and environment, because we count on cop27 when it comes to financing,” she added, noting that a series of meetings took place with financial institutions like global environment facility (#gef).

She faced a lot of transportation problems as she had to go here and there to grab her art supplies and research for different projects. So her father decided to buy her a scooty to ease her everyday life. 
Shanzy going to her university on a scooter inspired more girls in her batch to get one and go around more feasibly. Now the only problem she and her fellows were facing was the unpleasant ride because of all eyes staring at them, unwanted comments passed on the streets, and sometimes even being followed and stalked by random people. 
Being harassed in a public space made them constantly worried about physical safety and feel a heightened sense of anxiety, or to be “on edge” at all times.

Just then they were introduced to Iyzil in one of their university seminars about “Women claiming public spaces without the fear of being harassed” and how Iyzil is doing its part to assure Pakistani women are empowered for their own safety.

Shanzy learned about the app’s Responders Ring feature, added all her five scooty fellows to her Iyzil responders ring. Now she has her own scooty gang and whenever any of her fellow members face any kind of street harassment or any other emergency situations, they just hit the panic alarm and whoever’s close by comes to rescue her friend. And also, Iyzil 24x7 Professional Monitoring Team contacts them to make sure that they are safe or if the situation is serious they involve emergency service on users consent.

Shanzy and her scooty gang say that they found saviors in Iyzil's Professional Monitoring Team and feel more empowered with Iyzil when on road.

Volker Turk opened an emergency session of the UN Human Rights Council, where countries were called to discuss Iran's ""deteriorating human rights situation"" and determine if a high-level international investigation is warranted.

The meeting, requested by Germany and Iceland with the backing of more than 50 countries, follows two months of protests in Iran sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, after she was arrested for an alleged breach of the country's strict dress rules for women based on Islamic sharia law.

""I call on the authorities immediately to stop using violence and harassment against peaceful protesters,"" said Turk, the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights.

""The unnecessary and disproportionate use of force must come to an end,"" he said, warning that Iran was in ""a full-fledged human rights crisis.""

""Accountability is a key ingredient of the pursuit of justice for human rights violations,"" he told the 47-member council, urging the body to vote in favour of an investigation.

Iranian authorities have grown increasingly heavy-handed in their response, as the demonstrations have spread across the country and swelled into a broad movement against the theocracy that has ruled Iran since 1979.

Turk said more than 300 people had been killed since Amini's death. Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has put the toll above 400, including more than 50 children.

""The security forces... have used live ammunition, birdshot and other metal pellets, tear gas and batons,"" said Turk.

A total of 3,159 cumulative vulnerabilities have been discovered in the popular web browser, out of which 303 have been reported this year. The Atlas VPN team has not disclosed the severity but has just published the number of vulnerabilities. The figures are from the VulDB vulnerability database. The report summarises vulnerabilities reported in the database between January 1, 2022, to October 5, 2022.

Mozilla’s Firefox browser comes second with 117 vulnerabilities, and Microsoft Edge comes third with 103 vulnerabilities, which is 61% higher than the previous year. Since its release, it has had 806 vulnerabilities in total, the report states.

Apple’s Safari is the second-most widely used browser worldwide after Google Chrome and is also the safest browser with just 26 vulnerabilities reported for 2022 and 1,139 vulnerabilities overall since its debut. The report advises users to be particularly careful while choosing plug-ins as they can be malicious and has asked users to choose only reliable providers.

Recently Indian cyber agency the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) issued a high-severity advisory regarding vulnerabilities in Chrome through which hackers can gain access and execute malicious operations in the system.

Google has one of the most transparent vulnerabilities reporting processes out of all the companies, and according to experts, the same will be fixed via updates. Current users can safeguard themselves by updating their browsers to the latest version.

Network data from NetBlocks confirm a near-total disruption disruption to internet service in parts of Kurdistan province in west Iran from the evening of Monday 19 September 2022. The regional telecommunications blackout in and around Sanandaj follows a partial disruption to internet service in Tehran and other parts of the country on Friday when protests first broke out. The Instagram social media platform and WhatsApp messaging app were subsequently restricted nationally on Wednesday 21 September, followed by a nation-scale shutdown of mobile networks.

The incidents come amid widening protests against the government after the death of Mahsa Amini from Saqqez in Kurdistan province after her arrest by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating Iran’s strict hijab headscarf rules.

Observable connectivity was restored some 3.5 hours after the disruption came into place in Iran’s Kurdistan region, amid reports of at least four protesters killed by authorities. Users have also reported the disconnection or severe slowing of internet service in multiple cities since the first disruption was registered on Friday 16 September 2022. The network disruptions are likely to severely limit the public’s ability to express political discontent and communicate freely.

Our Streets Now is a campaign working to end public sexual harassment (PSH) through cultural and legislative changes. Public sexual harassment is unwanted sexual attention by strangers in public spaces including gyms, bars, parks, and the streets. PSH can be leering, unwanted comments, beeping from passing vehicles, and even following.
👇
As a campaign, we use real-life testimonies from victims in order to illustrate the impact and reality of PSH. If you would like to share your experience (s) of PSH, you can submit yours via our website.

Since 16 September 2022, Iranian people have taken to the streets to protest against the Islamic Republic following the brutal murder of Mahsa Jina Amini, a young Kurdish woman, at the hands of government forces. 

The Islamic Republic has been a major source of oppression against women, religious and ethnic minorities, and Iranian society as a whole. Freedom is non-existent, the economy is deteriorating, the environment is degraded. Protests spanning across 146 cities have rapidly turned into Iran’s first ever feminist-led revolutionary movement. Its motto is “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” in Kurdish, “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” in Farsi, or “Woman, Life, Freedom” in English. 

Over 18,000 people have been arrested since the start of this revolution. Amongst them are people of all genders, ages, beliefs, and sexual orientations: children, striking workers, artists, lawyers, actresses, athletes, nurses and doctors, students and teachers, families of those arrested or killed. All those actively opposing the current regime know they are at risk of incarceration.

In addition, the Islamic Republic’s parliament has formally called upon the judiciary to impose death penalties against all jailed protesters. Though few have been sentenced to death so far, this move provides the grounds for others to suffer the same faith. Even one death sentence is one too many. This is one of the many strategies used by the government to deter opposition and protest. Other strategies include violence, torture, rape, as well as intimidation, harassment, and threats against activists and their families.",,,,"6,362",4.65,"“bricks of a revolution”

These are some of the people living in North America who have a long track record of lobbying in support of Khamenei’s regime occupying Iran. They’re mainly active on Twitter, in addition to making media appearances and publishing articles to echo the talking points of the regime in English to a Western audience. They do this by presenting themselves as “progressives” who just want peace and stability. Their main tactic is to use nice sounding terms such as “anti-war” and “diplomacy” to make it seem like they are not on the side of the regime. But their main goal is to keep this ISIS-style dictatorship in power no matter what. They have been lying to their Western audience for years, claiming that people in Iran do not want the regime gone, they just want “reforms”. This, of course, is absolute nonsense. They falsely accuse political prisoners, family members of innocent people killed by the regime, and other Iranian activists, of being “warmongers”. They whitewash the crimes of the regime and have always tried to hijack mass protests in Iran to misrepresent them.

With the recent huge anti-regime protests taking place in Iran and the clear message of the Iranian people, which is that they do not want the Islamic Republic in power, their constant rambling has not stopped one bit. Their tactics slightly change from time to time to fit the situation and not be too evident, but their goal is always the same. Some of them are desperately trying to save face now, even going back to delete their previous articles, tweets, and videos. Of course, it’s too late and completely pointless since people have downloaded, taken screenshots, and saved it all!

Stay alert, know their names, and do not fall for their tricks! Iran will be free one day, and when that day comes, I assure you that Iranian people will not forget or forgive those who for years lobbied for that barbaric oppressive regime while living comfortably in North America!

Allah was added to the flag after the Islamic revolution in 1979 by the regime. Thank you team USA. Many Iranians are also posting thank you comments under their page.

us national soccer team has removed the religious “allah” emblem from middle of iranian flag. this religious symbol represents iran’s theocratic oppression, gender apartheid and hate which most iranians reject and want removed. allah was added to the flag after the islamic revolution in 1979 by the regime. thank you team usa. many iranians are also posting thank you comments under their page.
در حین نشان دادن جدول مسابقات تیم ملی فوتبال امریکا در صفحات اینستاگرم و توییتر خود پرچم ایران را  بدون خرچنگ‌جمهوری اسلامی نشون دادند. مردم ایران هم دارند مرتب در کامنتا ازشون تشکر میکنند.

“While she was scaling that wall in Seoul without the state’s forced hijab, Ms. Rekabi was showing the world who she is: A professional climber and Iranian woman with a spine of steel,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“She, like countless women in Iran, has risked everything to tell the world that she opposes the state’s policy of forced hijab, and we are extremely worried about her safety,” he added.

“Ms. Rekabi risked her freedom and safety and has since been under extreme pressure by the government to cover up her courageous act of civil disobedience,” said Ghaemi. “It is now the responsibility of all people who support women’s and human rights to stand with her and not let the government in Iran cover up the true story.”

CHRI stands by Iranian athletes who are calling for the government in Iran to be held accountable for its repressive policies, and calls on the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFCS) to suspend Iran’s membership.

CHRI also urges the IFCS, climbing professionals and the international community to not accept the Iranian government’s attempts to flip this story.

These groups and individuals should make statements in support of Rekabi, who has not been allowed to speak freely since she competed, and all women in Iran who are risking their lives to speak out against repressive state policies.

The actual numbers are likely higher. The government has provided zero evidence to back up its claims about what happened at the prison, which is why we are not reporting their statements right now.

Today families of prisoners in Evin gathered outside the prison, as shown in this video. 

Since last night, some prisoners, including some political prisoners, were able to call their families to let them know their condition, but the prison has a capacity of 15,000 and could be over-capacity due to the high influx of protesters who were sent there in the past four weeks—this means thousands of families are potentially still waiting for information about their loved ones.

Prisoners in the women’s ward were reportedly attacked last night with tear gas, tweeted former political prisoner Atena Daemi while referencing her source inside the prison. Her tweets below have been translated into English by the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI):  “From a prisoner in the Women’s Ward: The siren was heard from 8:30 last night. Mohammadi, head of security, and Hayat-Algheib, head of State Prisons Organization, came to Evin Prison. [Inmates] broke the door and entered the outer area of the ward. Then they brought a sniper.” 

Follow up tweet: “Profanity was said. Prisoners without hijab chanted death to the dictator. They fired a lot of tear gas; some are still having lung problems today. Then [inmates] were guided inside the prison. At the moment everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”

There were more protests in Iran today, five weeks after Mahsa Amini, 22, was pronounced dead just days after she was arrested by the morality police.

At Tehran University today protesters chanted, “Tehran has become a prison! Evin has become a slaughterhouse!”

Both journalists are in great danger given Iranian intelligence agencies' cowardly attempts to pin the country's anti-state protests, which the Raisi government has been unable to crush, on the two women.

The intelligence agencies, both with documented histories of torturing and killing targets of the state, offered no evidence to justify their slander and incorrectly claimed that Niloufar had tweeted a photo of Mahsa Zhina Amini in the hospital, when she had only tweeted a photo of Amini's parents embracing in grief. Elahe, meanwhile, is being persecuted for reporting on Amini's funeral in Saqqez, Kurdistan province. In summary, these women journalists are being attacked for doing their jobs as journalists, which is legal even under the laws of the Islamic Republic.

When you share about people being held in prison in Iran, specifically by name, you are helping save their life. 
Fame buys safety.

On Nov 24, the UN Human Rights Council @unitednationshumanrights voted for a Fact-Finding Mission, into examining the human rights abuses In
Iran. This puts even more pressure on the
regime to portray a good image internationally.
Since the UN vote, the regime in recent days has released hundreds of detainees like Katayoun Mahmoudifar. Some of these released detainees include a prominent human rights activist, a famous 
actress and two former footballers among others. 
Posting on social media is the BEST way to help! 
Iranians are begging us to keep posting so that the regime is put under pressure. The Islamic Regime of Iran knows the world is watching, and is afraid of being held accountable.

One of the slides has a TW. While it may feel overwhelming to read; please remember that it is reality for many Iranians. Turning our eyes away from their pain, is invalidating their suffering. When we are aware, we are able to amplify better. 

Reach out to Iranians you know in your community. All of them are undergoing severe mental distress. Send them love, strength and solidarity. Ask how you can support them better. Share posts that they are sharing & stand united with them.

There is nothing as isolating than to have your yoga teacher or fellow practitioner invalidate what you, or the people in your country are going through. If you are a non-Iranian reach out to your yoga teacher and ask him/her to share. 
Stand in Solidarity. 

Simultaneously, do stand in solidarity with people from across the world facing war, protests, oppression, systemic violence, ethnic cleansing, genocide, gender/religious/race & caste based violence, climate events… 
From Palestine, Kashmir, Ukraine, China, Syria, India to Tibet…

“All across Iran, protesters have been risking their lives to call for an end to the Islamic Republic’s violent repression,” said Ghaemi.

“The state’s attempts to crush peaceful protest through killings, arrests, and imprisonment is a prelude to more severe state violence against Iran’s citizenry, which can only be halted through strong, collective, international action,” he said.

* CHRI calls on the Islamic Republic to release a public accounting of all political prisoners and detainees and their whereabouts, as well as a public listing of all those who have been killed since September 16, 2022, when anti-state protests erupted in the country.

* CHRI also urges the international community, including government leaders, the UN, and bar associations across the world, to call on the government in Iran to release all detained protesters and political prisoners and halt its crackdown on peaceful dissent.

* The U.S. and its partners should also pursue the establishment of an urgent special session at the U.N. Human Rights Council so that governments can collectively address the violence against protesters and establish an investigative, reporting, and accountability mechanism for the Islamic Republic’s many serious crimes.

“Doctors who’ve spoken out against Islamic Republic forces occupying medical buildings and who are trying to treat wounded protesters are engaging in a courageous defense of the right to life and deserve international solidarity,” said CHRI Executive Director Hadi Ghaemi.

“Members of the medical community shouldn’t have to risk their lives to call on authorities to allow them to provide care in a safe environment, yet that’s what’s happening in Iran as we speak,” he added.

“The international medical community should join human rights groups in urgently calling on the Iranian government to allow doctors to protect human life without the threat of death or arbitrary arrest,” said Ghaemi. “And call for the immediate release of all detained medical workers.”

Many people in Iran who’ve been wounded amid the protests are too afraid to go to a hospital for treatment because protesters seeking medical help have been detained, according to several accounts shared with CBS News from both inside and outside Iran.

On October 25, members of the Tehran Medical Council issued a statement condemning state security forces patrolling medical buildings in search of protesters: “As members of the Tehran Medical Council, we condemn the military, police, security, and unidentified forces for entering medical universities and hospitals and demand that they stop.”

The statement also called “for the protection of the detainees and their families.”

She has been in detention since Sept 21, 2022. Elaheh Mohammadi, a Mihan newspaper journalist, is also another reporter in detention for going to Saqqez to investigate and report on Mahsa’s funeral.

Today, the Intelligence Ministry of the Islamic Republic and the Intelligence Service of IRGC published a joint-statement about recent protests in Iran and officially accused Niloufar and Elaheh to help the “foreign media” to propagate a biased narrative of what happened around Mahsa’a death. They were accused of doing so by publishing photos of her on the hospital bed (which showed head trauma) and reports of her funeral in Saqqez and people’s protest after that. In the statement, they claim that the two reporters has been trained on foreign soil to work for “the US mafia-like regime”. In recent days many reporters have been detained and are said to be kept in very harsh conditions in the prisons of Iran.

A number of girls and women who once played a variety of sports posed for an @apnews photographer for portraits with the equipment of the sports they loved. They hid their identities with burqas, the all-encompassing robes and hood that completely cover the face, leaving only a mesh to see through. They didn’t normally wear the burqa, but they said they sometimes do now when they go outside and want to remain anonymous and avoid harassment.⁠
⁠
The ban on sports is part of the Taliban’s escalating campaign of restrictions that have shut down life for girls and women.⁠
Even before the Taliban, women’s sports were opposed by many in Afghanistan’s deeply conservative society, seen as a violation of women’s modesty and of their role in society. Still, the previous, internationally-backed government had programs encouraging women’s sports and school clubs, leagues and national teams for women in many sports.⁠

All my rather short life has been opening mouth to speak up followed by broken teeth, in the U.S. and in the Middle East, freedom of expression that expires with expression. The whole concept is a fallacy. Anybody is free to express, even in North Korea. Freedom AFTER expression matters. I will keep speaking up. Silence suffocates an outlier like me, not all those gone teeth. I do not need them.

Last week, we overturned Meta's original decision to remove a Facebook post protesting the Iranian government, containing the slogan ""marg bar Khamenei."" As part of our recommendations, we told Meta to permit the general use of the slogan on its platforms during protests in Iran, which they fully implemented effective today.

The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression, and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. It is vital that Meta supports users' voice. ""Marg bar"" is used as a political slogan in Iran to mean ""down with,"" not as a credible threat.

We will continue to closely scrutinize how Meta implements recommendations made in the ""Iran slogan protest"" case, and related recommendations issued in decisions since and share updates of our assessment in our quarterly transparency reports. 

We look forward to receiving Meta's other responses to our recommendations in this case ahead of the 60-day deadline.

We are glad to see Meta fully implement our recommendation ASAP in this case.",,,24,-4.67,"from today, users on instagram and facebook will be able to use the phrase ""death to khamenei"", which is the literal translation of ""marg bar khamenei"", in the context of the ongoing protests in #iran!

last week, we overturned meta's original decision to remove a facebook post protesting the iranian government, containing the slogan ""marg bar khamenei."" as part of our recommendations, we told meta to permit the general use of the slogan on its platforms during protests in iran, which they fully implemented effective today.

the iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression, and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. it is vital that meta supports users' voice. ""marg bar"" is used as a political slogan in iran to mean ""down with,"" not as a credible threat.

we will continue to closely scrutinize how meta implements recommendations made in the ""iran slogan protest"" case, and related recommendations issued in decisions since and share updates of our assessment in our quarterly transparency reports. 

we look forward to receiving meta's other responses to our recommendations in this case ahead of the 60-day deadline.

The Board recommends that Meta permit the general use of the slogan on its platforms during protests in #Iran. 

The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression, and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. ""Marg bar"" is used as a political slogan in Iran to mean ""down with,"" not as acredible threat. It is vital that Meta supports users' voices. 

Public comments submitted to the Board also indicate that ""marg bar Khamenei"" has been used widely during the recent protests in Iran. Many of these posts would have been removed without benefitting from the newsworthiness allowance, which permits otherwise violating content if the public interest outweighs the risk of harm. The Board found that Meta rarely applies it. 

The centrality of language and context should be reflected in Meta's policies, especially when assessing threats to heads of state who are legitimately subject to criticism. 

Meta must do more to respect freedom of expression in protest contexts, including in Iran.

Khamenei.” This literally translates as “death to Khamenei” but is often used as political rhetoric to mean “down with Khamenei.” 

In the Iranian context, the Board finds that Meta must do more to respect freedom of expression, and permit the use of rhetorical threats. The Iranian government systematically represses freedom of expression and digital spaces have become a key forum for dissent. In such situations, it is vital that Meta supports users’ voice. 

The content in this case was posted days before Iran’s “National Day of Hijab and Chastity"". Given the national day was approaching, Meta should have anticipated issues around the over-removal of Iranian protest content, and prepared an adequate response. For example, by instructing “at-scale” reviewers not to remove content containing the “marg bar Khamenei” slogan.

As this case shows, its failure to do so led to the silencing of political speech aimed at protecting women’s rights, including through feature-limits, which can shut people out of social movements and political debate.

The Board has made recommendations to better protect political speech in critical situations, such as that in Iran, where historic, widespread, protests are being violently suppressed. This includes permitting the general use of “marg bar Khamenei” during protests in Iran.
