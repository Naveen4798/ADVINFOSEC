This one sentence brought on incredulous laughter from my teacher, fiery objections from my classmates, popcorn GIFs, and claims that such a statement is not only wrong but harmful. To use it is irresponsible! It will push people away from Islam!

I deliberately choose to use the word ‘patriarchal’ when describing Islam - neither to complain nor to be edgy or contrarian, but because I don’t believe there is any other way of putting it. Let’s look at the facts:

- All of the prophets, the pioneers of our religion, were male.
- The Prophet (s) said in an authentic narration that no nation will prosper with a woman as leader.
- Allah said that men are qawwāmūn over women.
- Mixed congregations should only be led by men.
- Inheritance is primarily patrilineal.

The list goes on.

It’s undeniable. It’s as clear as day. To deny that Islam is patriarchal is to bury one’s head in the sand and ignore the very cornerstones this religion is built upon.

I felt drained and depleted after debating with my classmates about it, like I had just spent considerable time and energy defending my use of the word “blue” in describing the sky.

Of course, the difference is that “blue” doesn’t carry so much baggage.

▪️BAD BOYS & DADDY ISSUES ▪️

I am sympathetic to the fear that calling Islam patriarchal will deter people from the religion. After all, the word sounds very similar to its big bad brother, The Patriarchy. The Patriarchy looms over us all. It abuses its power. It kills, rapes, and sexually harasses with little to no accountability or consequence.

You’ll be happy to hear that ‘patriarchal’, its lower-case little brother adjective, has nothing to do with any of that. Like ‘blue’, it paints a picture of a much less sinister reality. It describes, as adjectives do.

Adjectives do not deter people from religion - abusers do. The effects of their abuse is persistent and traumatic.

Just how a father’s abuse can condemn his daughter to a lifetime of toxic romantic relationships, men of God who abuse their power can cause their victims to be attracted to ideologies inconsistent with Islamic values and harmful to their faith. 

These ideologies - typically feminism and secular liberalism - are the attractive bad boy. The disenchanted pack their bags and flock to them in droves. And why wouldn’t they? The promise of enjoying freedom and equal opportunity shines bright. However, like an oasis in the desert, this sparkle is illusory.

For a long time now but especially in light of the senseless killing of #MahsaAmini, many Muslims - hijabis, at that - have been jumping on the down-with-the-patriarchy bandwagon. They incorrectly use the verse ‘there is no compulsion in religion’ to espouse “my body, my choice” narratives. They support and celebrate women publicly removing their hijabs as an act of protest, not realizing how strong a nefarious grip secularism and feminism have come to have on their headscarf-covered necks.

These are women who love their religion. They covet Islamic teachings about truth and justice. Unfortunately, in adopting these ideologies, they unknowingly begin to compromise the very faith they hold so dear to their hearts. The relationship becomes toxic.

My argument is that in using the word ‘patriarchal’, it becomes clearer that Islam and ideologies like feminism are at odds - a premise that is not apparent to many well-meaning Muslim victims of male oppression. It is not immediately apparent because both Islam and feminism seek to protect women’s rights, but they differ in that Islam very clearly and exclusively places men at the top of a social hierarchy that must be respected.

In recognising that Islam at its very core is a patriarchal religion, we think twice about adopting worldviews like feminism which seek to dismantle the very systems it upholds, and seek out healthier ways of coping with injustice. We stop falling for the bad boy because of our daddy issues. We enter into our healing phase.

▪️ NICE GUYS ▪️

In our current political climate where the allure of these ideologies is stronger than ever, this Patriarchal Religion - up against feminism and secular liberalism - is in need of some good PR. In come the Nice Guys.

 If these ideologies are the attractive bad boy, then apologists are the Nice Guys.

Nice Guys aren’t as suave, but they use flowery words and are very polite. They swoop in to save the damsel in distress. They seek to defend Islam from its detractors, to protect women from the attractive bad boy in the black leather jacket. They are the white knights.

The problem is that these apologists are armchair experts. They are not scholars. They are made of flesh and bones and good intentions. These are the guys who think having a YouTube channel and a following gives them the authority to talk about the religion.

NE17 Chopwell 

*UPDATED*
We have had another report of a sighting of Gem in High Spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. This could confirm that Gem was on the pavement next to Dovecote Care Home HIGH SPEN on Thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. Does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time? It would be greatly appreciated❤️

*UPDATED*
It’s been 3 weeks now without Gem. My family and I are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,183,-1.56,"still missing  2nd september

STILL NO SIGN OF HER SINCE MONDAY 8/8 10:30am. JACK RUSSELL TERRIER, FEMALE, 10 YEARS OLD, WHITE WITH TRI-COLOUR FACE, BLACK CIRCULAR SPOT ON BACK, DOCKED TAIL

SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,96,-2.68,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

To my Iranian sisters and brothers, seeing Iran go through this terrifying time breaks my heart. Iranian authorities continue to harass, arrest, and prosecute those seeking accountability and justice. The world needs to know what is happening to the many defenceless but brave people who are tortured, tormented and even killed just because they are seeking their fundamental human rights. 
Your pain is my misery; your suffering is my grief. I am not an activist, but I can be your voice, telling your story to my non-Iranian/Australian friends and the World. 
The World should know that all they are asking is basic freedom! 
It is not only about wearing a hejab, it is about being controlled. 
Iranian women encounter discrimination in personal matters associated with marriage, divorce, inheritance, and decisions relating to children and custody. In Iran a woman may not obtain a passport or travel outside the country without written permission from her husband, father or brother, who can revoke such consent at any minute. 
Despite tremendous challenges, Iranian women have had a long and critical history of activism. In the mid-19th century, Qurrat al- Ayn aka Tahirh, Iran’s first martyr, fearlessly fought conventional norms by appearing unveiled in public. Her last words prior to being strangled was “You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.” History is repeated again #mahsaamini.
We are entitled to equal rights, regardless of skin colour, background, and religion.

🛑LA MUERTE DE LA JOVEN, QUE HABÍA SIDO ARRESTADA POR LA “ POLICÍA DE LA MORAL”, GENERÓ UNA MULTITUDINARIA PROTESTA]
🛑 🇮🇷 Las mujeres de Irán se sacaron sus velos en protesta por la muerte de Mahsa Amini, la joven iraní de 22 años que murió este viernes tras permanecer en coma luego de ser arrestada y trasladada a la comisaría por la llamada ""policía de la moral"". Su delito habría sido no llevar puesto su velo de forma ""apropiada"".

🔳 Masha Amini, había viajado a Teherán -la capital iraní-, la semana anterior y allí fue detenida por la denominada Policía de la Moral, porque no tenía colocado el velo (hiyab), como lo establecen las leyes islámicas.

⭕ Luego, en unas imágenes de video, pudo observarse a Amini en una dependencia policial para recibir una clase de ""educación y orientación"", y mientras dialogaba con una agente se desplomó repentinamente.

🔲 Algunos rumores indicaban que la mujer había sido golpeada durante el traslado hacia esa dependencia, aunque la policía negó la versión, y afirmó que había sufrido un problema cardíaco. Finalmente, Amini fue internada en un hospital, y este viernes se confirmó su fallecimiento, y tras el funeral miles de mujeres se autoconvocaron para expresar su repudio por el hecho, en distintos puntos del país.

🔴 La mayor concentración se dio en Saghez, la ciudad natal de la mujer, donde las participantes se quitaron sus velos en un claro desafío a la normativa actual. De todas maneras, la policía intervino y unas horas después dispersó la concentración arrojando gases lacrimógenos a la multitud.

🔘 Por su parte, Amnistía Internacional exigió la investigación, por vía penal, de las acusaciones de tortura y otros malos tratos por parte de la policía.

⭕ ""Las autoridades iraníes deberían abolir el uso compulsivo del hiyab y remover o reformar otras leyes que privan a las mujeres de sus derechos y autonomías"", afirmó el organismo a través de la red social twitter.

We have had another report of a sighting of Gem in High Spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. This could confirm that Gem was on the pavement next to Dovecote Care Home HIGH SPEN on Thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. Does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time?

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe.

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,13,-5.46,"still missing  2nd september

Repost @the.wellness.therapist
To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out

NE17 Chopwell 

*UPDATED*
We have had another report of a sighting of Gem in High Spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. This could confirm that Gem was on the pavement next to Dovecote Care Home HIGH SPEN on Thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. Does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time? It would be greatly appreciated❤️

*UPDATED*
It’s been 3 weeks now without Gem. My family and I are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,4,-16.75,"still missing  2nd september

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,3,-6.67,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,2,-16.0,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

📌 WHAT: Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Rights estimates that since September -7, at least 201 persons, including women and children, have been killed by Iran’s security forces and pro-government vigilante volunteers, during protests over the custodial death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.

🩸 Iranian security forces in Zahedan city have killed at least 90 people amid demonstrations against a police officer accused of rape in a separate case. The government has called the protesters “separatists”. 

🥀 Iran's Children's Rights Protection Society says at least 28 children have been killed. 

👉🏼 At least 1,200 people have been arrested, including at least 20 journalists, per Iran Human Rights. 

❗️Iran’s Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi told Iranian media on October 5 that the ""average age of the detainees from many of the recent protests was 15"". 

❗️❗️ In an interview with an independent  Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have been detained and referred to “psychological institutions” to be “reformed”. 

✊🏾 The women-led protests continue, 26 days on. They have now spread across Iran, with many activists calling the protests a national uprising. The rallying cry: Women, Life, Freedom. 

📷 The image in the post graphic has been sourced from Twitter, where people are crowdsourcing protest artwork, often anonymously from Iran. The image depicts the bleeding ear that can be seen in Mahsa Amini’s final photo from a hospital, right before she died, lending credence to eye witness claims and media reports that she was beaten by the morality policy after being detained for wearing her hijab ‘improperly’.

✊🏾 the women-led protests continue, 26 days on. they have now spread across iran, with many activists calling the protests a national uprising. the rallying cry: women, life, freedom. 

📷 the image in the post graphic has been sourced from twitter, where people are crowdsourcing protest artwork, often anonymously from iran. the image depicts the bleeding ear that can be seen in mahsa amini’s final photo from a hospital, right before she died, lending credence to eye witness claims and media reports that she was beaten by the morality policy after being detained for wearing her hijab ‘improperly’.

SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,0,-26,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

In Condemnation of killing students in #Iran
 
Background:
 
The murder of Jina (Mahsa) Amini in Sep 16, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman visiting Tehran from Saqqez, ignited an uprising in Kurdistan which briskly went beyond the Kurdish communities and spread across Iran, forming the most radical feminist movement in recent history of the country.
 
The movement touched the schools and students fundamentally. High School students joined the uprising from the very beginning, and schoolgirls have been at the forefront of the schools’ protests both within the educational spaces and in the streets. The security forces responded to the peaceful protests brutally and mercilessly. At least 300 are confirmed dead since the beginning of the uprising, out of which 50 are under 18 years old. 50 children are killed in less than 50 days and new murders are reported each single week. Like all other previous experiences, the security forces’ treatment of protesters from non-Persian groups have been the bloodiest; some 58 percent of the victims are Baluchis and Kurds. And speaking from the children’s numbers, 62.5 percent of the casualties are from Baluchistan and Kurdistan. But unfortunately, the horrific news of the murder of the students, children and teenagers has not been reflected properly by the international and English media. Through this twitter storm, the Coordinating Council of the Iranain Teachers’ Trade Association (CCITTA) aims to publicize the case of the murder of more than 50 students, children and teenagers in the past two months in Iran.

This one sentence brought on incredulous laughter from my teacher, fiery objections from my classmates, popcorn GIFs, and claims that such a statement is not only wrong but harmful. To use it is irresponsible! It will push people away from Islam!

I deliberately choose to use the word ‘patriarchal’ when describing Islam - neither to complain nor to be edgy or contrarian, but because I don’t believe there is any other way of putting it. Let’s look at the facts:

- All of the prophets, the pioneers of our religion, were male.
- The Prophet (s) said in an authentic narration that no nation will prosper with a woman as leader.
- Allah said that men are qawwāmūn over women.
- Mixed congregations should only be led by men.
- Inheritance is primarily patrilineal.

The list goes on.

It’s undeniable. It’s as clear as day. To deny that Islam is patriarchal is to bury one’s head in the sand and ignore the very cornerstones this religion is built upon.

I felt drained and depleted after debating with my classmates about it, like I had just spent considerable time and energy defending my use of the word “blue” in describing the sky.

Of course, the difference is that “blue” doesn’t carry so much baggage.

▪️BAD BOYS & DADDY ISSUES ▪️

I am sympathetic to the fear that calling Islam patriarchal will deter people from the religion. After all, the word sounds very similar to its big bad brother, The Patriarchy. The Patriarchy looms over us all. It abuses its power. It kills, rapes, and sexually harasses with little to no accountability or consequence.

You’ll be happy to hear that ‘patriarchal’, its lower-case little brother adjective, has nothing to do with any of that. Like ‘blue’, it paints a picture of a much less sinister reality. It describes, as adjectives do.

Adjectives do not deter people from religion - abusers do. The effects of their abuse is persistent and traumatic.

Just how a father’s abuse can condemn his daughter to a lifetime of toxic romantic relationships, men of God who abuse their power can cause their victims to be attracted to ideologies inconsistent with Islamic values and harmful to their faith. 

These ideologies - typically feminism and secular liberalism - are the attractive bad boy. The disenchanted pack their bags and flock to them in droves. And why wouldn’t they? The promise of enjoying freedom and equal opportunity shines bright. However, like an oasis in the desert, this sparkle is illusory.

For a long time now but especially in light of the senseless killing of #MahsaAmini, many Muslims - hijabis, at that - have been jumping on the down-with-the-patriarchy bandwagon. They incorrectly use the verse ‘there is no compulsion in religion’ to espouse “my body, my choice” narratives. They support and celebrate women publicly removing their hijabs as an act of protest, not realizing how strong a nefarious grip secularism and feminism have come to have on their headscarf-covered necks.

These are women who love their religion. They covet Islamic teachings about truth and justice. Unfortunately, in adopting these ideologies, they unknowingly begin to compromise the very faith they hold so dear to their hearts. The relationship becomes toxic.

My argument is that in using the word ‘patriarchal’, it becomes clearer that Islam and ideologies like feminism are at odds - a premise that is not apparent to many well-meaning Muslim victims of male oppression. It is not immediately apparent because both Islam and feminism seek to protect women’s rights, but they differ in that Islam very clearly and exclusively places men at the top of a social hierarchy that must be respected.

In recognising that Islam at its very core is a patriarchal religion, we think twice about adopting worldviews like feminism which seek to dismantle the very systems it upholds, and seek out healthier ways of coping with injustice. We stop falling for the bad boy because of our daddy issues. We enter into our healing phase.

▪️ NICE GUYS ▪️

In our current political climate where the allure of these ideologies is stronger than ever, this Patriarchal Religion - up against feminism and secular liberalism - is in need of some good PR. In come the Nice Guys.

 If these ideologies are the attractive bad boy, then apologists are the Nice Guys.

Nice Guys aren’t as suave, but they use flowery words and are very polite. They swoop in to save the damsel in distress. They seek to defend Islam from its detractors, to protect women from the attractive bad boy in the black leather jacket. They are the white knights.

The problem is that these apologists are armchair experts. They are not scholars. They are made of flesh and bones and good intentions. These are the guys who think having a YouTube channel and a following gives them the authority to talk about the religion.

NE17 Chopwell 

*UPDATED*
We have had another report of a sighting of Gem in High Spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. This could confirm that Gem was on the pavement next to Dovecote Care Home HIGH SPEN on Thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. Does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time? It would be greatly appreciated❤️

*UPDATED*
It’s been 3 weeks now without Gem. My family and I are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,183,-1.56,"still missing  2nd september

***urgent missing dog*** please share
***reward upon safe return***
still no sign of her since monday 8/8 10:30am. jack russell terrier, female, 10 years old, white with tri-colour face, black circular spot on back, docked tail, no collar
ne17 chopwell 

*updated*
we have had another report of a sighting of gem in high spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. this could confirm that gem was on the pavement next to dovecote care home high spen on thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time? it would be greatly appreciated❤️

*updated*
it’s been 3 weeks now without gem. my family and i are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. she has to be out there somewhere. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

if you see a jack russell, look twice. it could be her! look for her big black spot on her back. 

please take your mind back to monday 8th august. did you see anything suspicious on mill road chopwell? do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted gem being picked up by someone? any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

we have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. someone must have her. 

our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

we have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby dovecote care home high spen. thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to waterworld, prudhoe. 

we are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

my little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is not normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. this has never happened before. 
someone must know something. 
at 10:30am on monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of chopwell. we were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. she is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
has someone picked her up? is she in someome’s home right now?

she is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. she does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. the area has been throughly searched. we haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

in 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. she is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. she doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
please get the word out there

our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. this is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, you will be rewarded.

i have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. we have rang local vets. she is reported on dog lost. i have left an item of my clothing where i saw her last and at our gate. i have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. posters have been put around our local area.

thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. we need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

🛑LA MUERTE DE LA JOVEN, QUE HABÍA SIDO ARRESTADA POR LA “ POLICÍA DE LA MORAL”, GENERÓ UNA MULTITUDINARIA PROTESTA]
🛑 🇮🇷 Las mujeres de Irán se sacaron sus velos en protesta por la muerte de Mahsa Amini, la joven iraní de 22 años que murió este viernes tras permanecer en coma luego de ser arrestada y trasladada a la comisaría por la llamada ""policía de la moral"". Su delito habría sido no llevar puesto su velo de forma ""apropiada"".

🔳 Masha Amini, había viajado a Teherán -la capital iraní-, la semana anterior y allí fue detenida por la denominada Policía de la Moral, porque no tenía colocado el velo (hiyab), como lo establecen las leyes islámicas.

⭕ Luego, en unas imágenes de video, pudo observarse a Amini en una dependencia policial para recibir una clase de ""educación y orientación"", y mientras dialogaba con una agente se desplomó repentinamente.

🔲 Algunos rumores indicaban que la mujer había sido golpeada durante el traslado hacia esa dependencia, aunque la policía negó la versión, y afirmó que había sufrido un problema cardíaco. Finalmente, Amini fue internada en un hospital, y este viernes se confirmó su fallecimiento, y tras el funeral miles de mujeres se autoconvocaron para expresar su repudio por el hecho, en distintos puntos del país.

🔴 La mayor concentración se dio en Saghez, la ciudad natal de la mujer, donde las participantes se quitaron sus velos en un claro desafío a la normativa actual. De todas maneras, la policía intervino y unas horas después dispersó la concentración arrojando gases lacrimógenos a la multitud.

🔘 Por su parte, Amnistía Internacional exigió la investigación, por vía penal, de las acusaciones de tortura y otros malos tratos por parte de la policía.

⭕ ""Las autoridades iraníes deberían abolir el uso compulsivo del hiyab y remover o reformar otras leyes que privan a las mujeres de sus derechos y autonomías"", afirmó el organismo a través de la red social twitter.

It’s been 3 weeks now without Gem. My family and I are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,13,-5.46,"still missing  2nd september

Protests are now being reported in every province in ⁦‪the country‬⁩. The government admits to killing 35 but Amnesty says they shot 19 people dead — including 3 children — on Wednesday night alone. 

This is the culmination of 43 years of oppression. It is starting to seem as though the government has two choices — reform, or revolution. 

Iran's main reformist party called Saturday for an end to the mandatory Islamic dress code for women in force since 1983, after eight straight nights of protests. #mahsaamini #iran

Repost @the.wellness.therapist
To the international community, our sisters & brothers in Iran have lost access to the internet. They are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. The regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. They are being killed in the dark. I humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

Iranians are asking for those outside of Iran to their voice. Share their stories. Don’t let their deaths be in vain. Scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.

1. Repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

The Islamic Republic of Iran regime  is blocking the internet. Iranians have to use VPN & other dangerous methods to get content out. When we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of Iranians. They want us to help get their stories out. 

Doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. Footage being widespread online also raises morale of Iranians to keep protesting. 

2. Use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out

protests are now being reported in every province in ⁦‪the country‬⁩. the government admits to killing 35 but amnesty says they shot 19 people dead — including 3 children — on wednesday night alone. 

this is the culmination of 43 years of oppression. it is starting to seem as though the government has two choices — reform, or revolution. 

iran's main reformist party called saturday for an end to the mandatory islamic dress code for women in force since 1983, after eight straight nights of protests. #mahsaamini #iran

repost @the.wellness.therapist
to the international community, our sisters & brothers in iran have lost access to the internet. they are risking their lives by simply refusing to wear the hijab & to peacefully protest. the regime of the islamic republic of iran has shut down their connection to the outside world. they are being killed in the dark. i humbly ask for your support in sharing their stories & how they are courageously risking life & limb just to be heard. 

iranians are asking for those outside of iran to their voice. share their stories. don’t let their deaths be in vain. scroll to learn ways to help them & share this post along with others.

1. repost footage of protests to all social media platforms 

the islamic republic of iran regime  is blocking the internet. iranians have to use vpn & other dangerous methods to get content out. when we reshare the videos/photos that do get out, we are helping to amplify the voices of iranians. they want us to help get their stories out. 

doing so also scares the regime because they don’t want the international community to see what is happening. footage being widespread online also raises morale of iranians to keep protesting. 

2. use specific & creative hashtags to get the word out

NE17 Chopwell 

*UPDATED*
We have had another report of a sighting of Gem in High Spen from a reliable source in the same place as our previous report. This could confirm that Gem was on the pavement next to Dovecote Care Home HIGH SPEN on Thursday 11/8 around 1:20pm. Does anyone have camera footage they could check from this day around this time? It would be greatly appreciated❤️

*UPDATED*
It’s been 3 weeks now without Gem. My family and I are struggling to cope not knowing where she is or how she disappeared. SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,4,-16.75,"still missing  2nd september

STILL NO SIGN OF HER SINCE MONDAY 8/8 10:30am. JACK RUSSELL TERRIER, FEMALE, 10 YEARS OLD, WHITE WITH TRI-COLOUR FACE, BLACK CIRCULAR SPOT ON BACK, DOCKED TAIL

SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,3,-6.67,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

Sendit is an add-on to Snapchat, not a standalone app: it requires users to have an active Snapchat account, which they then connect to Sendit. It’s important that trusted adults realise, therefore, that any risks associated with Snapchat also affect children using Sendit. Within the app, people play question games like ‘Truth or Dare’ and ‘Never Have I Ever’: users select a question to share on their Snapchat story for their friends to reply to. All responses are anonymous, although – for paying subscribers – Sendit reveals hints about who sent which messages. 

In the guide, you'll find tips on a number of potential risks such as bullying, harassment and grooming.

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*Original post*
My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,2,-16.0,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10 

where is gem ? 

please can everyone keep sharing, we need to make her too hot to handle
she has to be somewhere?
someone has to have seen her or seen something?

we will never stop looking for her shes our family & has been for 10 years & we need her home where she belongs 💔

***urgent missing dog*** please share
***reward upon safe return***
still no sign of her since monday 8/8 10:30am. jack russell terrier, female, 10 years old, white with tri-colour face, black circular spot on back, docked tail

she has to be out there somewhere. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

if you see a jack russell, look twice. it could be her! look for her big black spot on her back. 

please take your mind back to monday 8th august. did you see anything suspicious on mill road chopwell? do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted gem being picked up by someone? any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

we have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. someone must have her. 

our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

we have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby dovecote care home high spen. thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to waterworld, prudhoe. 

we are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

*original post*
my little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is not normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. this has never happened before. 
someone must know something. 
at 10:30am on monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of chopwell. we were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. she is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
has someone picked her up? is she in someome’s home right now?

she is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. she does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. the area has been throughly searched. we haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

in 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. she is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. she doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking.

📌 WHAT: Oslo-based NGO Iran Human Rights estimates that since September -7, at least 201 persons, including women and children, have been killed by Iran’s security forces and pro-government vigilante volunteers, during protests over the custodial death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.

🩸 Iranian security forces in Zahedan city have killed at least 90 people amid demonstrations against a police officer accused of rape in a separate case. The government has called the protesters “separatists”. 

🥀 Iran's Children's Rights Protection Society says at least 28 children have been killed. 

👉🏼 At least 1,200 people have been arrested, including at least 20 journalists, per Iran Human Rights. 

❗️Iran’s Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi told Iranian media on October 5 that the ""average age of the detainees from many of the recent protests was 15"". 

❗️❗️ In an interview with an independent  Iranian newspaper, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed that some school students have been detained and referred to “psychological institutions” to be “reformed”. 

✊🏾 The women-led protests continue, 26 days on. They have now spread across Iran, with many activists calling the protests a national uprising. The rallying cry: Women, Life, Freedom. 

📷 The image in the post graphic has been sourced from Twitter, where people are crowdsourcing protest artwork, often anonymously from Iran. The image depicts the bleeding ear that can be seen in Mahsa Amini’s final photo from a hospital, right before she died, lending credence to eye witness claims and media reports that she was beaten by the morality policy after being detained for wearing her hijab ‘improperly’.

Mohammadi, head of security, and Hayat-Algheib, head of State Prisons Organization, came to Evin Prison. [Inmates] broke the door and entered the outer area of the ward. Then they brought a sniper.” 

Follow up tweet: “Profanity was said. Prisoners without hijab chanted death to the dictator. They fired a lot of tear gas; some are still having lung problems today. Then [inmates] were guided inside the prison. At the moment everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”

There were more protests in Iran today, five weeks after Mahsa Amini, 22, was pronounced dead just days after she was arrested by the morality police.

At Tehran University today protesters chanted, “Tehran has become a prison! Evin has become a slaughterhouse!”

#اوین",,,,1,-0.94,"evin prison update: iranian officials have reported four deaths, 61 injuries, and four hospitalizations of individuals in critical condition so far. the actual numbers are likely higher. the government has provided zero evidence to back up its claims about what happened at the prison, which is why we are not reporting their statements right now.

today families of prisoners in evin gathered outside the prison, as shown in this video. 

since last night, some prisoners, including some political prisoners, were able to call their families to let them know their condition, but the prison has a capacity of 15,000 and could be over-capacity due to the high influx of protesters who were sent there in the past four weeks—this means thousands of families are potentially still waiting for information about their loved ones.

SHE HAS TO BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. 

https://www.facebook.com/sophie.meadows.100

If you see a Jack Russell, LOOK TWICE. It could be her! Look for her big black spot on her back. 

Please take your mind back to Monday 8th August. Did you see anything suspicious on Mill Road Chopwell? Do you have cameras outside your house that could have spotted Gem being picked up by someone? Any information big or small is helpful and extremely appreciated. 

We have ruled out the idea of her being in a rabbit hole. Someone MUST have her. 

Our 2 pointers have been out everyday searching with us but they haven’t given us a promising sign that we hoped for. 

Over 300 posters are up in the area and more will be going up in areas we haven’t yet covered. 

We have had 2 possible sightings but can’t be sure without a photograph. Thursday 11/8 around 1.20pm along the main road nearby Dovecote care home High Spen. Thursday 11/8 around 6:30-7pm in the trees in the corner of the bowling green next to Waterworld, Prudhoe. 

We are so grateful for people getting in touch and for those sharing this post, please continue to do so❤️

Our hope is not lost and we will never give up, but please, if you do know anything, come forward and put our minds at ease ❤️

My little sidekick of 10 years is still missing, this is NOT normal behaviour and she should have come home by now. This has never happened before. 
SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. 
At 10:30am on Monday 8th august we were walking 5 minutes away from my home at the bottom of Chopwell. We were in a small woodland area next to the horse fields. She is able to get into the back street and the main road from this field. 
HAS SOMEONE PICKED HER UP? IS SHE IN SOMEOME’S HOME RIGHT NOW?

She is known for going down rabbit holes but is good for running back to the house after 10-20 minutes. She does not wander off on her own and she would know how to return home if she had. The area has been throughly searched. We haven’t heard a single bark or whine from her at any point in our search.

In 10 years of her life, there has been two occasions, which are both quite recent, when she has went to the main road (one of which following the scent of a dead bird on the road at the top of our street) Our worry is that somebody has picked her up from here explaining why she hasn’t returned home on her own. Someone could even think they are doing the right thing by looking after her until getting into contact with a local vet or dog warden. She is a very friendly dog who would go up to anyone. She doesn’t bark at people either therefore if someone picked her up, no attention would be drawn from barking. 
PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT THERE

Our first instinct was that she was stuck in a rabbit hole but we are beginning to believe someone has her. This is a much loved family pet, if you can return her, YOU WILL BE REWARDED.

I have reported her as lost to our microchip company and payed for a lost dog alert to be sent to local pet professionals in a 30 mile radius. We have rang local vets. She is reported on dog lost. I have left an item of my clothing where I saw her last and at our gate. I have walked our other dogs around typical walks we go on in case they pick up a scent. Posters have been put around our local area.

Thankyou to everyone who has been sharing, please continue to do so. We need everyone to recognise this dog. ❤️

This is an urgent appeal for help, please, if you know anything, come forward and fix the heartbreak in our home.",,,,0,-26,"gem is still missing  3rd october 2022  -chopwell gateshead ne10

In Condemnation of killing students in #Iran
 
Background:
 
The murder of Jina (Mahsa) Amini in Sep 16, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman visiting Tehran from Saqqez, ignited an uprising in Kurdistan which briskly went beyond the Kurdish communities and spread across Iran, forming the most radical feminist movement in recent history of the country.
 
The movement touched the schools and students fundamentally. High School students joined the uprising from the very beginning, and schoolgirls have been at the forefront of the schools’ protests both within the educational spaces and in the streets. The security forces responded to the peaceful protests brutally and mercilessly. At least 300 are confirmed dead since the beginning of the uprising, out of which 50 are under 18 years old. 50 children are killed in less than 50 days and new murders are reported each single week. Like all other previous experiences, the security forces’ treatment of protesters from non-Persian groups have been the bloodiest; some 58 percent of the victims are Baluchis and Kurds. And speaking from the children’s numbers, 62.5 percent of the casualties are from Baluchistan and Kurdistan. But unfortunately, the horrific news of the murder of the students, children and teenagers has not been reflected properly by the international and English media. Through this twitter storm, the Coordinating Council of the Iranain Teachers’ Trade Association (CCITTA) aims to publicize the case of the murder of more than 50 students, children and teenagers in the past two months in Iran.
